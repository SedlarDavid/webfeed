            <description>It nails the two things it was built for: low-latency Luna play and solid
                everyday performance.</description>

<p>Normally listed at $69.99, this controller isn&rsquo;t required to use <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxArVD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Luna&amp;short_url=QxArVD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Luna</a>, but it&rsquo;s clearly built with the platform in mind. Unlike standard Bluetooth controllers, it connects to Amazon&rsquo;s servers over wifi, which supposedly helps reduce input lag by 17 to 30 milliseconds. That might not sound huge, but for fast-paced games, it can make a real difference.</p><p>The design is familiar and comfortable. It has a similar feel to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OoA7?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Nintendo%20Switch%20Pro%20Controller&amp;short_url=z7OoA7&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>, with offset analog sticks, A/B/X/Y face buttons, and a solid build that feels responsive in hand. There&rsquo;s a Luna button in the center that lights up when the controller is active, along with a built-in microphone button for Alexa support, a headphone jack at the bottom, and a USB-C port for wired use. It runs on two AA batteries, which are included in the box, and it also supports <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObnoY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=rechargeable%20AA%20batteries&amp;short_url=QObnoY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">rechargeable AA batteries</a> if you already have a set. A USB-C cable isn&rsquo;t included, but most people likely already have one.</p><p>If your primary use is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxArVD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20Luna&amp;short_url=QxArVD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon Luna</a>, the wifi setup allows you to switch between devices such as Fire TV, tablets, and browsers without needing to reconnect the controller each time. Once it&rsquo;s set up through the Luna Controller app, it just works, making the experience smoother. You can also use it as a standard Bluetooth controller on Windows, though it requires a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRWbD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=separate%20driver&amp;short_url=9wRWbD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">separate driver</a> download. PCMag recently re-evaluated this <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx2Dy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=controller&amp;short_url=znx2Dy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">controller</a> and gave it an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-luna-controller" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Excellent&rdquo;</a> rating after Amazon improved its Bluetooth support. All in all, if you&rsquo;re invested in Luna or want a solid controller that can handle cloud and local play, it&rsquo;s one of the more practical add-ons you can get.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why I’m Excited for Amazfit’s New 'Helio Strap' Fitness Tracker</title>

            <description>It’s $99 and does a lot of what Whoop does, but without a subscription.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Amazfit recently launched its <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr242D?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Helio%20Strap&amp;short_url=Qr242D&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Helio Strap</u></a>, the third of the three <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/three-different-whoop-competitors-might-be-coming-soon" target="_blank"><u>once-rumored Whoop-like trackers</u></a> to be officially announced. It&rsquo;s the only one you can buy <em>right now</em>, and its features and price (just $99.99) look pretty sweet.&nbsp;</p><p>A brief history lesson: The first of the three Whoop-like trackers to be announced was something from Polar. That&rsquo;s all we know&mdash;there's no name of the device or even a photo, although the shadowy image from the <a href="https://www.polar.com/en/media-room/polar-to-launch-new-device-new-product-category-this-september" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>press release</u></a> looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/business/polar-360?srsltid=AfmBOoqzzRQFSEmB2ezCny3EXhasOI2PgceiYvXUsbQjMUK_9HkB2EI9" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Polar 360</u></a>, a device that was never marketed directly to consumers. The price has not been announced, but it will be &ldquo;subscription-free.&rdquo; The second was Garmin&rsquo;s Index sleep monitor, which sells for $169.99, is also subscription-free, and is meant to be used only for sleep, not sports. (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-is-now-selling-its-new-sleep-band" target="_blank"><u>I found the product description to be underwhelming</u></a>, though I haven&rsquo;t gotten my hands on a review unit yet.)&nbsp;Finally, we have <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr242D?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazfit%E2%80%99s%20%2499%20Helio%20band&amp;short_url=Qr242D&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Amazfit&rsquo;s $99 Helio band</u></a>, which was previously teased by pro Hyrox athletes and just became available to the rest of us last week. My review unit is on its way, but I can say from looking at the specs that this is the band I&rsquo;m most excited for. It&rsquo;s what Garmin <em>should</em> have released, and it sets the standard that Polar will have to match.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-price-is-hard-to-beat">The price is hard to beat</h2><p>It&rsquo;s hard to envision paying <em>more</em> than $100 for a screenless strap. After all, the idea is that it does half of what a watch does (it collects data, but doesn&rsquo;t have a screen to display it). I try to give Whoop a pass on being screenless because its app is so thoughtfully designed and does a ton of analysis and planning&mdash;in Whoop&rsquo;s case, you&rsquo;re really paying for the service more than the hardware.&nbsp;But if you&rsquo;re going to buy a device for a flat fee, I find it hard to stomach Garmin&rsquo;s $169 price tag when you would likely wear it in addition to a Garmin watch that costs anywhere from $200 to possibly over $1,000. Also, Garmin&rsquo;s device is just for sleep. The Helio strap is for sleep <em>and</em> workouts, so you arguably get twice as much use for just a little over half the price.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="you-can-use-it-for-both-exercise-and-sleep">You can use it for both exercise and sleep</h2><p>Garmin&rsquo;s device is just for sleep, and Polar&rsquo;s <em>may</em> be for 24/7 wear (we don&rsquo;t know yet), but Amazfit&rsquo;s is explicitly meant for exercise in addition to wearing it to sleep.&nbsp;The company boasts that it has 27 exercise modes, which doesn&rsquo;t sound like a ton, but I&rsquo;m intrigued by the &ldquo;smart strength training&rdquo; and a Hyrox race mode. (Hyrox is a <a href="https://hyrox.com/the-fitness-race/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>fitness racing sport</u></a>, where competitions have you run between exercise stations, doing things like burpees and sled pushes. Several Amazfit watches have a <a href="https://uk.amazfit.com/pages/amazfit-hyrox" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>mode</u></a> that can keep track of the different segments of this competition.)</p><p>Amazfit plans to sell an armband for the Helio strap, although their website says it&rsquo;s not available yet. Personally, I love when trackers have an armband option for strength or functional fitness activities, since kettlebells and wrist wraps tend to interfere with anything wrist-based.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="its-garmin-not-whoop-that-should-be-scared">It&rsquo;s Garmin, not Whoop, that should be scared</h2><p>According to press materials, the Helio strap has a 10-day battery life. The data from the strap feeds into the Zepp app, the same as that of other Amazfit watches, so you can swap between the Helio strap and any Amazfit watch you may happen to own, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47RDk?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=T-Rex%203&amp;short_url=Q47RDk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>T-Rex 3</u></a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z620Dj?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Bip%206&amp;short_url=z620Dj&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Bip 6</u></a>&mdash;or the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnKMO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Balance%202&amp;short_url=aRnKMO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Balance 2</u></a>, which somehow manages to stuff dual-band GPS, offline maps, and a sapphire glass screen into a $299 package.&nbsp;It's the kind of thing Garmin watch users have been asking for: Something that lets people take their watch off while still feeding data into the same app as their regular watch. Something that has a good battery life and a relatively affordable price tag. Something you can wear during activities, not just for sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>The Helio strap even features something called BioCharge, which sounds a lot like Garmin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Body Battery.&rdquo; Body Battery is a number that goes up when you sleep or recover, and goes down when you exercise or are stressed. I ignore it, personally, but I know a lot of people like to keep tabs on a numerical metaphor for how energetic they might feel throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>The one thing I&rsquo;m not so sure about is GPS. It&rsquo;s not mentioned in any of the Helio strap&rsquo;s specifications, and a note about battery life mentions that they&rsquo;re assuming outdoor workouts occur with the strap linked to your phone&rsquo;s GPS. This is similar to what Whoop does, letting them keep the device small and power-efficient by completely eliminating location tracking tech. But it comes with tradeoffs: Your phone&rsquo;s GPS may not be as accurate as a watch (depending on your phone, of course), and it eats into your phone&rsquo;s battery rather than the device&rsquo;s. That said, if you&rsquo;re tracking an outdoor run, you probably want to wear your watch anyway&mdash;bringing us back to the two-device setup that Amazfit probably hopes you&rsquo;ll buy into.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The idea is that the AI in your smart glasses recognizes advertisements in your visual field and "edits them out' in real time, sparing you from ever seeing what <em>they</em> want you to see. </p><p>While Spanhove's video shows a red block over the offending ads, you could conceivably cover that Wendy's ad with anything you want&mdash;an abstract painting, a photo of your family, an ad for Arby's, etc.</p><h2 id="how-close-are-we-to-real-life-ad-blocking">How close are we to real-life ad-blocking?</h2><p>While it's a test at present, real-life ad-blocking for the people doesn't seem far off. The technology is there now: current-generation consumer AI glasses like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ray-ban-meta-glasses-review" target="_blank">Meta Ray Bans</a> can already identify what you're looking at with scary accuracy. </p><p>Replacing ads is a little trickier, though. While there are AR smart-glasses on the market, like the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/xreal-air-2-pro-ar-glasses-cool-but-frustrating" target="_blank">XReal Airs</a>, and upcoming Snap Specs, and AR experiences in VR headsets like the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-quest-3-review-still-searching-for-a-reason-to-exist" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3</a> can already strip out parts of the real environment and replace them, there isn't anything on the market with full AR that is practical enough for wearing all the time. Battery life and weight are the problems, but those are solvable. There are so <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/2025-is-the-year-of-the-smart-glasses" target="_blank">many companies competing for the smart glasses market</a>, it seems like only a matter of time until it's practical to achieve real life ad-blocking.</p><h2 id="companies-versus-consumer-and-the-creation-of-the-ultimate-echo-chamber">Companies versus consumer and the creation of the ultimate echo chamber</h2><p>I could see this being a killer app for smart glasses in the near future: It's the kind of things that consumers would really want. But it's also the kind of thing that advertisers and marketers would really <em>not</em> want, and this might be the biggest obstacles to real-life ad-blockers. You could envision a "cat-and-mouse" game similar to the one that's been playing out online for years, with companies trying ingenious ways to thwart the ad-blocking glasses, like disguising ads as something else. Would there be legal challenges? Would there be issues with a mega corporation that releases smart glasses not wanting to piss off every other company? And what happens if you want to edit out ads for the very device you're wearing?</p><p>There are sociological concerns as well. People probably wouldn't stop at replacing ads with pixel art. They'd be editing out anything that personally annoys them: homeless people, construction sites, other humans who have traits they don't like. Curating your own visual experience in the real world could lead to the creation of personal echo chambers that make the world look more to your liking, but less like it is, the ultimate echo chamber.</p><p>Ethical concerns aside, I would be first in line for a pair of glasses that edited reality to my liking. I know <em>I</em> would use them responsibly, even if I'm not sure about everyone else.  Maybe I wouldn't wear them all the time. Just almost all the time. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>I have long been a gym regular (in large part because <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/group-fitness-etiquette-i-wish-everyone-knew" target="_blank">I work there</a> part-time as a spin instructor) and I have <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-review" target="_blank">owned my Peloton</a> for four years, but I never considered myself a workout fiend. But lately, I've gotten more serious about it. I'm <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/fitness-apps-i-use-every-day" target="_blank">using apps to monitor my protein intake</a>, filling my downtime with sports, and even&mdash;and especially&mdash;working out at home. </p><p>At-home exercise has long been a challenge for me, as I find I have trouble staying motivated the same way I do when I'm at the gym, but I've found some ways to keep myself consistent. Here are seven changes I've made that you can also try if you're struggling to convince yourself to break a sweat while your couch is beckoning to you from across the room.</p><h2 id="i-invested-in-equipment">I invested in equipment</h2><p>Money is a major motivator for me. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of all my Capricorn zodiac placements, the fact that I&rsquo;m an only child, or just a personality defect with no explanation, but the fact remains: I am incapable of enjoying a hobby without tying it to some kind of financial stakes. I can't simply like fashion; I have to constantly <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/poshmark-app-review" target="_blank">sell</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/pickle-clothing-rental-app-review" target="_blank">rent out</a> my clothes online so I can get money to buy <em>more</em> clothes. I can't simply take spin classes; I have to get certified so I can <em>teach</em> them. Teaching spin, it turns out, paid dividends for me: I got paid to do a thing I would otherwise be paying to do, <em>and </em>I got a free gym membership in the bargain. Initially, however, that backfired: Because I was no longer paying for my gym membership, I stopped going to the gym when I wasn't teaching. Turns out that financial motivator was key to my productivity.</p><p>To rectify this, I've started funneling money into health and fitness in other ways. In addition to buying month-to-month packages at boutique gyms, like pilates studios, I've invested in at-home equipment. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review" target="_blank">The Peloton app</a> alone costs me $44 per month, which is probably a large part of why I'm on an 106-day streak of riding my Bike every day. </p><p>I also began collecting workout equipment, like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8JMR?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=weights&amp;short_url=QL8JMR&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">weights</a>, a sturdy <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDmGm?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=yoga%20mat&amp;short_url=9yDmGm&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">yoga mat</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbWM6?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=yoga%20blocks&amp;short_url=QbbWM6&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">yoga blocks</a>, and random tools like <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx254?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=resistance%20bands&amp;short_url=znx254&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">resistance bands</a> and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp754v?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=strange%20little%20device&amp;short_url=Qp754v&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">strange little device</a> for more effective body-weight squats. I keep it all in the open in my living room so that I  have to consider my investment every day. If I don't use it, I'll know my money is going to waste. It's an aggressive defense against my own lazy tendencies, but it works for me. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>If your plan is just to follow along with a few at-home "crunch challenges" or plyometrics you find on Instagram, you may lose motivation since it's not really costing you anything. Up the ante with a little monetary investment and you'll feel the burn, both in your wallet and your core. </p><p>This also addresses one of the other ways the gym tends to be better than at-home workouts: The more equipment you have, the more you can do, and the more you'll <em>want</em> to do. It's no fun to follow along with a YouTube video or a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/pelotons-strength-plus-app-review" target="_blank">Peloton strength workout</a> and not have the right tools. Spending not only money, but time, figuring out what you need to meet your goals is worthwhile. </p><h2 id="i-set-specific-goals">I set specific goals</h2><p>I used to have pretty nebulous fitness goals: "Lose weight. Be healthier." Those are nice ideas to stick on a vision board, but they don't produce much in terms of planning or motivation. If you have a solid routine of going to the gym, they're easy enough to maintain, but if you need to get serious about forcing yourself off the couch and working out in your own home, I don't think they cut it. So I started mapping out much more specific goals, like "Do the splits by August." </p><p>You can set out to curl a certain weight by your next birthday, gain a certain circumference on your bicep by autumn, lose a certain amount of pounds by an upcoming event&mdash;it doesn't matter what your goals are so much as it matters that they're unique, actionable, measurable, and time-based. </p><p>I've found that for me, achieving the goal by my personal deadline is motivating enough to keep me focused. I set a goal to do a pistol squat by May and achieved it in April, which made me feel smug, and eager to move on to the next one. If a generaly feeling of superiority isn't enough for you, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-get-motivated-to-clean" target="_blank">try a rewards system</a>: If your goal is to curl 30 pounds by December and you're at 15 now, think of a reward you can allow yourself when you hit the 20 and 25 pound milestones, like a meal at a favorite restaurant. If you're on a weight-loss journey, consider allowing yourself one deluxe activewear purchase every time you go down a size. </p><p>Don't forget to track your progress toward your goals. Cristina Chan, a F45 Global Recovery Athlete, tells me that when it comes to staying motivated to work out solo, "Tracking your workouts in a way that&rsquo;s visual and rewarding can be a game-changer." She encourages clients to mark off a calendar, fill in a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/work/the-best-apps-for-staying-accountable-to-your-goals" target="_blank">habit tracker app</a>, or even put sticky notes on a wall to keep track of active days. "Seeing your consistency build over time is a powerful motivator and it shifts the focus to showing up, not just physical results."</p><h2 id="i-dress-to-impress-myself">I dress to impress (myself)</h2><p>Remember during lockdown when everyone was telling you to continue dressing for work, even when you were clocking in from home, because it would put you in a "work" mindset? I've done well applying the same logic to my workouts: Every day before I hop on my Peloton or situate myself on my yoga mat, I don a matching workout set. (My favorites come from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDmDn?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Set%20Active&amp;short_url=9yDmDn&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Set Active</a> because they're all color-coordinated and the fabric is compressive but comfortable.)</p><p>I <em>could</em> do my at-home workouts in my pajamas, but that doesn't put me in the "workout" headspace. It puts me in the "lounging" headspace. Making the conscious decision to get up and put on compressive garments, high socks, and a sturdy hair clip tricks my brain. I wouldn't lounge around all day in those tight clothes, so my mind automatically knows it's not time to lounge at all. Even if no one sees me in my matching sets, I "see" myself, and know what time it is. When I finish my at-home workout, I put on a new outfit, just as if I was leaving the gym. </p><p>I also prepare for an at-home workout like I would if I were heading to the gym. I mix some creatine into my water (I love the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpx7q?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Wellah%20creatine&amp;short_url=zjpx7q&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Wellah creatine</a> and am obsessed with matching <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgBrW?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=an%20Owala&amp;short_url=QGgBrW&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">an Owala</a> water bottle to my outfit), select <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-make-a-good-cardio-playlist" target="_blank">a perfect playlist</a>, and stretch well. </p><p>All of these rituals are about getting into the correct mindset. Your living room probably doesn't look like a gym or have gym vibes, so it's on you to make yourself feel like you're ready to work out.</p><h2 id="i-approximate-the-feeling-of-community">I approximate the feeling of community</h2><p>I do love being at the gym because I enjoy being around people. It's motivating to see the same faces every day and to be surrounded by people who are also working hard. When you're next to someone on a treadmill or taking a pilates class, you almost can't help but put some extra oomph into your own workout. Sadly, that energy is harder to replicate if you primarily work out from home. </p><p>This is why I love taking Peloton classes. The leaderboards make it easy to feel like I'm part of a real class, and I always feel a need to compete with other people&mdash;even faceless strangers whose output scores I'm trying to beat in a virtual setting. If you don't have a Peloton, there are other ways to accomplish this same thing. </p><p>One option is to set up challenge groups. Assemble a group of friends who will all commit to, say, submitting mid-workout selfies to a group chat once a day for accountability. (I follow a few different people who do this <em>publicly</em> via Instagram stories, but that's a stretch, even for me.) If none of your friends are into it, strangers on the internet will be: Search Reddit or Facebook for "fitness challenge" or "workout challenge." Add your city or some identifiers, like "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1682168545520516/posts/1820628235007879/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">for moms</a>," and you'll find a group of like-minded people who want to hold each other accountable. </p><p>A lot of virtual fitness instructors, like people who <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/best-free-spin-classes-on-youtube" target="_blank">upload cycling classes to YouTube</a>, offer live classes, too. Just like signing up for a class at the gym, this can force you to work out when you might not otherwise want to. You don't want to miss class or make other regulars wonder where you are.</p><h2 id="i-add-variety">I add variety</h2><p>A key component of working out is avoiding boredom, which isn't always easy in your own home. When you go to the gym, you see all kinds of people, have access to a variety of tools and resources, and can even find entertainment in your commute. If you work out in your living room, it likely contains no new people and limited equipment&mdash;and the commute to get there might oly involve standing up.</p><p>To inject some variety, I mix up what I'm doing on my Peloton. I <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-watch-youtube-on-your-peloton" target="_blank">watch YouTube videos</a>, play <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-lanebreak-rhythm-game-review" target="_blank">games</a>, and take scenic rides. I schedule <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-do-joint-peloton-workouts-with-friends" target="_blank">rides with friends</a> and have even taken classes in foreign languages just to force myself to pay extra attention to the on-screen metrics. Beyond the Peloton, I try to do an array of other kinds of workouts, though a lot of them&mdash;like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-stretching-classes-are-helping-me-do-the-splits" target="_blank">stretching</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/why-i-like-pelotons-meditation-classes" target="_blank">meditation</a>&mdash;are also available in the Peloton app. I even divvy days up the same as I would in the gym, focusing on legs one day, arms the next, and so on. </p><p>Just because you're working out at home doesn't mean you can't go outside. I consider outdoor jogs "at-home" workouts because they require the same additional motivators as doing yoga in my living room: There's no one there with me, it costs nothing, and I have to convince myself to get up and go. </p><p>If you're tired of the same four walls, stretch on your deck. Jog down the block. Get yourself out of the same room you're always in so that the workout feels fresh. </p><h2 id="i-keep-to-a-schedule">I keep to a schedule</h2><p>This one is a work in progress, but I think it's crucial. For a long time, I was tackling at-home workouts sporadically. Some days, I'd bounce out of bed to do a morning Peloton ride. Other days, I'd wait until bedtime to tucker myself out with my free weights. Lunch-break runs, yoga when I felt stressed, randomly deciding it was simply "YouTube pilates time" at 8 p.m.&mdash;all of this kept me moving, but there was no schedule or structure to keep me accountable to myself. </p><p>Now, I'm slowly figuring out the schedule that works best for me, which is harder in the summer months, when the likelihood of going out at night is much higher. As it stands, I'm doing morning Peloton rides on the days I'm not already teaching a spin class at 7 a.m. (with a 10-minute "cooldown" Peloton ride when I get home on the days I do teach), then immediately doing yoga, stretching, or mat pilates right after work at least three days a week. I also try to make sure at least one leisure activity a week is more activity than leisure, like golfing, playing basketball, or swimming, and those are usually slated for weekend afternoons. </p><p>"One strategy I always suggest to clients is habit-stacking/pairing your workout with something you&rsquo;re already doing every day," Chan advises. "For example, if you always have coffee in the morning, lay out your mat right after your last sip. That small trigger helps turn movement into a non-negotiable part of your routine, not something you have to constantly talk yourself into."</p><h2 id="i-try-to-be-kind-to-myself">I try to be kind to myself</h2><p>I'm serious about this one. I've been working hard for the last year or so to stop badmouthing myself when I don't do as well at something as I think I should. Getting down on yourself only worsens your mood, which isn't particularly motivating. There are days I really do not want or have time to work out, so I queue up a 10-minute meditation on the Peloton app to maintain my active days streak. I don't give myself grief about this, and that's key: I know that if I felt bad about it or made myself feel lazy or guilty, I'd start to associate those negative feelings with working out altogether&mdash;and then I might quit. </p><p>If I can stay positive, tell myself it's OK to have an off day as long as I get back at it tomorrow, and stay focused on my real goals instead of an arbitrary idea about how much I need to do every single day, I'll keep viewing working out as a fun and productive. And that means I'll be much more likely to hop on the Peloton the tomorrow morning. </p><p>Chan suggests having a "bare-minimum" workout allowance for those off days&mdash;your version of my Peloton meditations. "Some days, motivation just isn&rsquo;t there and that&rsquo;s normal," she says. "I tell my clients to always have a go-to &lsquo;bare minimum&rsquo; workout: five minutes of mobility or three sets of a simple bodyweight circuit. Even if that&rsquo;s all you do, you&rsquo;ve kept the habit alive. Most of the time, once you start moving, you&rsquo;ll want to keep going."</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Where to Get Free Moving Boxes for Your Next Move</title>

            <description>Moving boxes can be expensive, but can also be surprisingly easy to get for
                free.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moving to a new home is exciting, stressful, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-save-money-on-moving" target="_blank">expensive</a>. The average cost is <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/how-much-does-it-cost-to-move" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">just over $1,700</a>, but it can cost as much as $10,000 depending on how far you&rsquo;re moving and how complex your requirements are. One aspect that&rsquo;s easy to overlook is moving boxes, which typically cost from $2 to $4 on average. Specialty boxes like wardrobe boxes or TV boxes cost more, anywhere <a href="https://www.stackmoves.com/how-much-do-moving-boxes-cost/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">from $10 to $40 each</a>. Fortunately, you usually don&rsquo;t need new boxes, and there are options for getting your hands on free boxes so you can move as cheaply as possible.</p><h2 id="use-u-haul-box-exchange-for-people-giving-away-boxes">Use U-Haul Box Exchange for people giving away boxes</h2><p>U-Haul is where a lot of folks head for vehicles and supplies, and the company has a bare-bones program to reduce waste: The <a href="https://www.uhaul.com/Exchange/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">U-Haul Box Exchange</a> (part of its Customer Connect program). It&rsquo;s not a sure thing, but it&rsquo;s easy to use, with no registration or sign-up required. Pop in your zip code and see if anyone in your area is giving away boxes (or other moving supplies). If so, you can message them directly through the site and arrange to pick everything up. There&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll get a convenient hit, but it&rsquo;s worth checking regularly as soon as you know you&rsquo;re going to be moving.</p><h2 id="use-online-platforms-like-facebook-marketplace-and-freecycle">Use online platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Freecycle</h2><p>Many social platforms can be a source of free boxes, including:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a>. If you have a Facebook account, you can search <a href="https://lifehacker.com/is-it-better-to-use-nextdoor-or-facebook-marketplace-1848799896" target="_blank">Facebook Marketplace</a> for free boxes and other moving supplies.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Craigslist</a>&rsquo;s Free Stuff sections are usually goldmines of moving supplies, especially boxes.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Freecycle</a> is a platform where people explicitly seek to give away stuff they don&rsquo;t need anymore, and to find stuff for free they don&rsquo;t want to (or can&rsquo;t afford to) pay for. People routinely post moving boxes here, so it&rsquo;s worth it to join your local Freecycle group to see if you can score some. If you don&rsquo;t see any posts, you can make a request, which might prompt someone who hadn&rsquo;t thought about giving away their boxes.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://buynothingproject.org/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">The Buy Nothing Project</a> (formerly BuyNothing) is the same <a href="https://lifehacker.com/live-free-and-buy-nothing-1848014800" target="_blank">basic concept</a> as Freecycle: Once you sign up, you can scan for people giving away moving boxes or post a request for some.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nextdoor.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Nextdoor</a> is a neighborhood platform that connects folks living in the same area so they can communicate, solve problems, and organize the occasional block party. You can sign up (on the app or website) and join your new neighborhood&rsquo;s group, then check to see if anyone&rsquo;s giving away boxes (or politely ask for some).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://about.offerup.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">OfferUp</a> is a platform for <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-apps-you-ve-never-used-to-sell-your-used-furni-1850278382" target="_blank">buying and selling items</a>, but it also allows free listings. It&rsquo;s worth signing up to scan for free moving boxes that someone might be itching to get rid of.</p></li></ul><h2 id="ask-local-stores-that-discard-a-ton-of-boxes">Ask local stores that discard a ton of boxes</h2><p>Sometimes the best ways to do things are the old ways. People have been scrounging moving boxes from local businesses since the dawn of cardboard, and plenty of stores and other local spots in your area get tons of deliveries in cardboard boxes, which they then have to manage and recycle. Many of these businesses will be totally happy to give them to you. A few key places to check:</p><ul><li><p>Liquor stores</p></li><li><p>Book stores</p></li><li><p>Banks</p></li><li><p>Libraries</p></li><li><p>Schools</p></li><li><p>Convenience stores</p></li><li><p>Grocery stores</p></li><li><p>Department stores</p></li><li><p>Pharmacies</p></li><li><p>Restaurants</p></li></ul><p>A few phone calls or in-person visits could net you a ton of moving boxes at zero cost aside from your time and sweat equity. Often, you can just grab boxes from dumpsters located behind buildings or around loading docks.</p><h2 id="use-your-own-jobs-mailroom-loading-dock-or-waste-management">Use your own job's mailroom, loading dock, or waste management</h2><p>If you work somewhere that deals with a lot of shipments, you might check the mailroom, loading dock, or waste management area. Your co-workers might also be a great source of free boxes. Picking up a few at a time every day for a few weeks might supply all the boxes you&rsquo;ll need.</p><h2 id="ask-your-local-recycling-center">Ask your local recycling center</h2><p>If your area recycles <a href="https://lifehacker.com/unexpected-ways-to-use-old-cardboard-around-the-house-1849817365" target="_blank">cardboard</a>, you could head out on collection day and walk around, looking for a stack of flattened boxes you can easily scoop up for your own use. If you know of a recycling center in your area, you could also contact them about taking some of their cardboard boxes off their hands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>This Mac App Changed the Way I Give Presentations</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <description>It's perfect for when you need to reference your own notes while presenting
                on an external display.</description>
            <media:thumbnail

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Referencing notes on your laptop while you're using it to give a presentation is always awkward. If you mirror your displays, there's no way to see your notes without showing them to your audience, which isn't ideal. But using multiple displays is also kind of clumsy&mdash;you need to move your mouse from one display to the other every time you want to advance slides, which can throw you off.</p><p>There's no perfect solution to this problem, but a Mac app called <a href="https://www.beeno.app/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Beeno</a> comes close. This free, open source application by developer <a href="https://github.com/ak0manda" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Uli Kaufmann</a> places your entire second display in a window on your primary display. The basic idea is that you'll be able to see the presentation on your laptop without having to turn around and look at the display behind you. This means you can see the slides in front of you, instead of having to turn around to look at the presentation screen. It also means you can see and scroll through your notes <em>and</em> take control of the presentation, all on one screen. </p><p>Using the application is simple: You just need to run it when you have two displays connected. You will need to provide the appropriate permissions before everything starts working, and a window on your primary display will automatically pop up, showing you everything on the secondary display. The window is scalable, meaning you can resize it to fit alongside your notes or anything else you need to reference during the presentation. If you need to switch which display is in the window, you can right-click the menu bar and choose a different one.</p><p>I've been playing around with Beeno for a few weeks, and it works quite well&mdash;certainly I don't think I'll be awkwardly looking behind me during a presentation ever again. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Whether or not you&rsquo;ve ever been to a Juice Press store doesn&rsquo;t matter. What&rsquo;s important is that you know they offer a special chia seed pudding, and it&rsquo;s out of this world. Even I, a self-professed lover of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/revive-soggy-fast-food-with-air-fryer" target="_blank"><u>air-fried Popeye&rsquo;s chicken sandwiches</u></a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/these-bacon-wrapped-banana-bites-are-self-care-1850258827" target="_blank"><u>bacon wrapped banana bites</u></a>, cannot get enough of this surprisingly addictive vegan pudding. </p><p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried duplicating the pudding at home, but came up short every time.

<h2 id="the-right-blender-matters">The right blender matters</h2><p>Chia seeds are rather unusual&mdash;they're teeny tiny, but packed with nutrients. When stirred into liquid they have incredible absorption capabilities, lending the resulting mixture a gelatinous consistency. Juice Press chia seed pudding is vegan, which might have you asking how to get a stable, pudding-like consistency without some key animal ingredients and lots of whisking on the stove. Instead of eggs the structure relies on a cashews, with the chia seeds serving as a natural thickening agent. </p><p>The key to this pudding succeeding, then, is making a creamy, non-gritty cashew sauce with a high-powered blender. And this is where having the right equipment matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>My past blenders and even some food processors have had trouble breaking down the cashews into a fine texture. Now, soaking the cashews helps here, and this recipe will taste good no matter what blender you have, but making a true copycat with pudding-like consistency&mdash;smooth enough that you'd be surprised to learn it is made with nuts&mdash;requires a powerful motor, and sharp, durable blades.

<p>If you&rsquo;re a big raw foods person then you can cold-soak your cashews overnight, but I&rsquo;m fine with doing things the speedy way: Put the cashews in a bowl and cover them with just-boiled water. Let them soak for about 20 to 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Blend the cashew sauce</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>

<p>Drain the cashews and pour the nuts into the blender container. Add all of the other ingredients except the chia seeds. The Explorian model doesn&rsquo;t have any fancy presets, but frankly, you don&rsquo;t need them! (Here are my tips on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-make-the-cheapest-vitamix-blender-work-like-the-expensive-ones" target="_blank"><u>how to operate the Explorian</u></a> to reach its full potential.) </p><p>I like to start by pulsing the mixture to chop it up a bit. Use the pulse switch on the left side four or five times. Then start the Vitamix Explorian on the lowest speed setting, with the dial set to speed 1. Run the machine for about 10 seconds and then ramp up all the way to speed 10. The resulting mixture should be smooth and somewhat thick, kind of like a milkshake.</p><h3>3. Stir in the chia seeds and let it set</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ11BQREPP7PS4MRA6SE0FTC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1751307902.jpg" alt="Cashew sauce and chia seeds in a bowl." width="2000" height="1124" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ11BQREPP7PS4MRA6SE0FTC/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1751307902.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ11BQREPP7PS4MRA6SE0FTC/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1751307902.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ11BQREPP7PS4MRA6SE0FTC/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1751307902.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide"></span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Next, I pour the chia seeds into a container and stir the cashew sauce into the seeds. Make sure the seeds are thoroughly mixed in and not clumped up. I like to use a glass or plastic container so I can see what&rsquo;s going on under the surface. Let the pudding rest for 30 minutes so the seeds can begin absorbing liquid. They might settle a little during this time, so stir everything again to remix it. Cover the pudding and let it chill in the fridge for at least three hours to set.&nbsp;</p><p>The Explorian is great for making cozy hot soups in the winter and good old-fashioned summer smoothies, but this chia pudding is hands-down my favorite year-round recipe to whip up.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since 2023, some of the best deals in Amazon's annual sale are invite-only&mdash;you have to sign up for them in advance of the sale going live, and hope you get chosen to receive the discount. </p><p>These deals have become a common fixture for Amazon's major sales, including last fall's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/amazon-officially-announces-prime-big-deal-days-for-202-1850848692" target="_blank">Prime Big Deal Days</a>. With <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank">Prime Day 2025 kicking off on July 8</a>, you can expect to see more invite-only deals popping up around the site. Here's how to find and sign up for them, so you have a fighting chance at taking advantage of some great offers.</p><h2 id="who-is-eligible-for-prime-day-invite-only-deals">Who is eligible for Prime Day invite-only deals</h2><p>Only a select number of products will be invite-only deals. You'll be able to spot them via an "invite-only" banner visible on the product page. As <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVJpm?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20explains&amp;short_url=MVJpm&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon explains</a>, you <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-sign-up-for-amazon-prime-1850613497" target="_blank">must be a Prime Member</a> to sign up for the invite-only deals. What you're doing is essentially requesting an invitation to purchase the deal, which will come by email. </p><p>Here are the steps to sign up:</p><ol><li><p>Find an "Invite-Only Prime Deal" that you want to purchase. You can find these deals listed on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l37w0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Deals%20page&amp;short_url=9l37w0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Deals page</a> once Prime Day begins.</p></li><li><p>Navigate to the product detail page.</p></li><li><p>Select "Request Invite."

You can only buy one of the products that you were invited for, but you can request as many different product invitations as you want. The invitation will last as long as Prime Day lasts (four days this year), or as long as there is stick remaining.</p><p>Invite-only deals are usually some of Prime Day's most impressive offerings.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with any device connected to the internet, your cameras are susceptible to hacking. While threat actors are often focused on big-ticket spying targets <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/internet-connected-cameras-made-china-spy-us-infrastructure/story?id=118533418" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">like critical infrastructure</a>, individuals aren't immune. Your webcam, security camera, and even baby monitor can be exploited for any number of malicious purposes&mdash;but cybersecurity best practices can significantly reduce your risk. </p><h2 id="internet-connected-cameras-are-vulnerable-to-hacking">Internet-connected cameras are vulnerable to hacking</h2><p><a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/malware/webcam-hacking" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Webcam hacking</a> grants remote access to your device's camera, which allows bad actors to watch and record the camera view. This means that they can turn your camera on and off, see what the camera sees, and take photos and videos. The potential risks here include everything from snooping on your personal movements and private activities to recording footage for blackmail to "shoulder surfing" in order to steal data to tracking when you are home. Live feeds may also be shared or sold on the dark web, compromising your privacy, digital security, and possibly physical safety.</p><p>It's not just your phone and computer that are at risk. All kinds of internet-connected cameras commonly found in consumers' homes&mdash;security cameras, pet cams, baby monitors, and smart bird feeders, to name a few&mdash;can be hacked relatively easily. These cameras can be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/this-android-malware-is-attacking-smart-home-devices" target="_blank">integrated into botnets</a> or give threat actors access to other devices on your network. A recent report from cybersecurity firm BitSight (<a href="https://www.404media.co/cameras-exposed-to-the-internet-report/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">covered by 404 Media</a>) found that content from more than 40,000 unsecured cameras had been exposed online, with researchers noting that this estimate is likely <em>very</em> conservative. </p><p>Surveillance camera networks are also widespread and pervasive in our day-to-day lives. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/surveillance-camera-networks" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">outlined some of the ways</a> in which video surveillance is conducted and used in cities across the country, from automated license plate readers to mobile surveillance towers. The data are accessible to law enforcement, of course, but these cameras have also been targeted by hackers with live streams exposed online. BitSight also found compromised cameras in public spaces, such as gyms and stores. </p><h2 id="how-hackers-gain-access-to-your-camera">How hackers gain access to your camera</h2><p>Webcam hacking on your phone or computer is primarily the result of malware that allows threat actors to remotely take over your device and gain access to your camera. These programs, like Remote Access Trojans (RAT), are typically delivered via phishing attacks that trick you into clicking links to download and install malicious apps. </p><p>Other cameras connected to the internet may be accessed remotely using the default manufacturer usernames and passwords, which are often publicly available. Weak credentials can also be brute-forced, and older devices that no longer receive security updates may be especially susceptible to hacking.</p><p>You can search your camera on <a href="https://www.shodan.io/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Shodan.io</a>, which scans for internet-connected devices, or try to access it from a device outside your home network without logging in through a secure app or VPN. If you're successful, your camera could be exposed. </p><p>There are also a handful of red flags that your webcam may have been compromised. An obvious one is that your camera indicator light is on or flashing when you're not actually using your camera, such as for a Zoom meeting or video call. Other signs of a malware infection include a fast-draining battery, suspicious or unfamiliar apps or files on your device, strange network activity, and unexpected changes in your webcam settings. </p><h2 id="how-to-prevent-your-cameras-from-spying-on-you">How to prevent your cameras from spying on you</h2><p><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/cyber-hygiene-habits" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Good cyber hygiene</a> goes a long way toward protecting your devices from hackers. Be wary of clicking links found in emails, texts, social media posts, or other communication, as these may be phishing links used to spread malware that takes over your device. Never execute commands for CAPTCHA tests, a tactic <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/captcha-malware-warning" target="_blank">commonly used in ClickFix attacks</a>. </p><p>Keep your devices&mdash;including all internet-connected cameras&mdash;up to date with the latest firmware. Enable automatic updates if available, and check regularly for security patches that address vulnerabilities. Change the default usernames and passwords on your IoT cameras to something strong and unique (again, these defaults are often publicly known). Firewalls and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-paid-vpns" target="_blank">VPNs</a> are also useful tools for blocking unauthorized access to your network and devices. </p><p>This is also a good time to check which apps and services have access to your device's camera and disable any you don't recognize or that aren't essential to the app's functionality. Permissions are found in your device settings: </p><ul><li><p>Windows: <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; security &gt; Camera</strong></p></li><li><p>Mac:<strong> System Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Camera</strong></p></li><li><p>Android:<strong> Settings &gt; Security &amp; Privacy</strong> <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; <strong>Permission manager &gt; Camera</strong></p></li><li><p>iOS:<strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Camera</strong></p></li></ul><p>Finally, a low-tech form of protection is a webcam cover&mdash;or even a piece of tape&mdash;to block your camera's view when it's not in use. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-get-motivated-to-clean" target="_blank">Keeping your house clean</a> is like a second job&mdash;most people spend <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/americans-reveal-hours-spend-cleaning-homes-2004217" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">at least two hours a week</a> cleaning, with some putting in nine hours or <em>more</em>. But no matter <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-stick-to-cleaning-schedule" target="_blank">how much time</a> you spend scrubbing, mopping, and dusting, there&rsquo;s a good chance you missed a spot. Several spots, actually, because your home is a minefield of hidden filth, lurking mold, and forgotten crud in the form of items that need to be replaced more often than you might think. </p><p>These 10 household items might look superficially clean, or they might be hidden from view, or you might simply have grown blind to how dirty they are&mdash;but replacing them regularly is the only way to ensure your home is <em>really</em> clean.</p><h2 id="shower-curtains">Shower curtains</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Twice a year.</p><p>Bathrooms are natural breeding grounds for mold due to the damp environment, and the spot in your bathroom most prone to growing mold might surprise you: <a href="https://www.safehome.org/resources/germs-in-your-bathroom/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">It&rsquo;s your shower curtain</a> (and your curtain liner, if you use one). You've probably already encountered at least one shower curtain that was more mold than curtain in your life, but you shouldn&rsquo;t wait until yours resembles a Petri dish before replacing it&mdash;you should swap out the liner twice a year, and if you use a fabric curtain, make sure you&rsquo;re <a href="https://lifehacker.com/checklist-of-everything-you-are-forgetting-to-clean" target="_blank">washing it regularly</a> as well.</p><h2 id="mattresses">Mattresses</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every 10 years</p><p>Your mattress is probably not very supportive&mdash;or comfortable&mdash;after a decade anyway, but if you&rsquo;re not worried about your overall sleep experience on it, you should be worried about a decade&rsquo;s worth of skin flakes, saliva, sweat, dust, and other stuff it has been collecting. Even if you clean and flip your mattress religiously, you should still replace it at least once a decade to prevent a buildup of dust mites, fungus, or even mold.</p><h2 id="pillows">Pillows</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every two years</p><p>Like our mattresses, we tend to hang onto our pillows for way too long. In part, this is because we discount the sheer amount of saliva and skin flakes we&rsquo;re pumping into them as we sleep. Even if you still love your pillows and clean them regularly, you should replace them about every two years. If you use a pillow protector, you can probably squeeze an extra year or two out of them, however.</p><h2 id="toilet-seats">Toilet seats</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every five years</p><p>A properly cleaned and maintained toilet seat doesn&rsquo;t pose much of a health hazard, but most toilet seats will show significant wear and tear within 5-10 years, depending on use. Once the seat gets stained, shows cracks, or begins shifting around when you sit on it, it&rsquo;s time to swap in a new one&mdash;plus, it&rsquo;s a chance for a quick and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/easy-home-upgrade-projects" target="_blank">easy upgrade</a> for your bathroom.</p><h2 id="toilet-brushes">Toilet brushes</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every six months</p><p>A toilet brush can last longer than six months if you actually clean it and store it properly, but very few people do that, preferring to get it out of sight as quickly as possible after cleaning the toilet. If that&rsquo;s you, then you&rsquo;ve  probably got plenty of mold and bacteria growing in the brush holder right now. Twice a year you should just get a new one&mdash;sooner if it starts to smell bad or show visible staining</p><h2 id="sponges">Sponges</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Twice a month</p><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that sponges you use to scrape grime and bacteria off your dishes and counters are disgusting breeding grounds for bacteria. Even if you keep them dry or microwave them frequently, that kitchen sponge is going to become a health hazard within a few weeks. It&rsquo;s best to have a supply on hand and swap in a fresh one every two weeks or so.</p><h2 id="mop-heads">Mop heads</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every 2-6 months</p><p>Mops are essential cleaning tools, but they are not self-cleaning. Sure, you dunk them in soapy water and rinse them out, but mops are designed to absorb and hold dirt, so you&rsquo;ll never get a used mop head totally clean, and over time they&rsquo;ll become pretty filthy. A string mop should be replaced every 2-3 months depending on use. A microfiber mop head can last twice as long if you wash them regularly.</p><p>Aside from the germ factor, your mop heads will be less effective over time as they wear out. So even if your mop head looks pretty clean, you should replace it anyway if you want to keep your <em>floors</em> clean.</p><h2 id="brooms">Brooms</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every two years</p><p>Like mops, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/best-brooms-to-buy" target="_blank">brooms</a> work by transferring dirt from your home&rsquo;s floors to themselves. You can (and should!) clean your brooms about once a month&mdash;a brisk rinse with soapy water is all it takes&mdash;but even so, your broom will show real wear and tear within a few years. Broken bristles or bristles falling out is usually the sign that you&rsquo;ve waited too long to replace it.</p><h2 id="cutting-boards">Cutting boards</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Annually</p><p>Cutting boards, whether plastic or wood, need to be replaced&mdash;or significantly refurbished&mdash;every year. No matter how thoroughly you clean them, your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/best-kitchen-knives-to-buy-for-any-cooking-style-and-budget" target="_blank">knives</a> are slashing deep grooves into the material where bacteria can evade your cleaning efforts, proliferate, and potentially make you sick. And the cutting board will eventually stain, and no one wants to think about what <em>caused</em> that stain while they&rsquo;re chopping fresh veggies.</p><h2 id="plastic-storage-containers">Plastic storage containers</h2><p><strong>How often to replace: </strong>Every 1-3 months</p><p>Even though you wash your plastic food storage containers after every use, you still need to ditch them pretty often. Over time, plastic degrades (<a href="https://news.unl.edu/article/nebraska-study-finds-billions-of-nanoplastics-released-when-microwaving" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">creating microplastics</a>), and every time you thrust a fork or knife in there you&rsquo;re probably creating a tiny slice. This all combines to eventually make those storage containers little bacteria farms. Consider replacing them with glass containers: They&rsquo;re chemically inert, so they will last longer and pose much less of a health risk over time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Right now, it&rsquo;s down to $92.99 on Amazon, its lowest price yet according to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/best-price-tracking-tools" target="_blank">price trackers</a>. This price also includes <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j5qA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=a%20zippered%20sleeve&amp;short_url=91j5qA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">a zippered sleeve</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YW242?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=screen%20protector&amp;short_url=9YW242&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">screen protector</a>,&mdash;for context, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4ob8?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=the%20tablet%20alone%20sells%20for%20%24139.99&amp;short_url=av4ob8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">the tablet alone sells for $139.99</a>, so this <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgBv7?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=bundle&amp;short_url=zEgBv7&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">bundle</a> undercuts that pretty solidly. Plus, if your kid drops it or the tablet breaks, you&rsquo;re covered: Amazon includes a two-year worry-free guarantee that lets you swap it for a new one, no questions asked.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll get an 8-inch screen that&rsquo;s bright enough for indoor use, 32GB of storage with room to expand, and up to 10 hours of battery life, according to this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-fire-hd-8-kids-pro-2024" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a>. It&rsquo;s not lightning fast, and the display isn&rsquo;t going to wow anyone, but for reading, light gaming, and video calls, it does the job. The speakers are on the weak side, but Bluetooth 5.2 and a headphone jack offer <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-kids-headphones" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">better audio options</a>. Additional value comes from the six-month Amazon Kids+ trial included in the bundle, which gives access to a huge library of books, games, shows, and educational tools like Math Claw and Marvel Reads. You can also set screen time limits, approve download requests, and track activity using the parent dashboard.</p><p>Once the free trial ends, a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amazon-merges-kids-plus-plans-into-all-in-one-subscription" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Kids+ plan</a> costs $5.99 per month, or more if you&rsquo;re not a Prime member. Without the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKGVw?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=subscription&amp;short_url=akKGVw&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">subscription</a>, the tablet still works, but the experience can feel a bit limited. Still, for under $100 with the sleeve and screen protector included, this bundle makes a lot of sense if you&rsquo;re not quite ready to hand over an $800 iPad to a 6-year-old.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Instant Pot became a household name back when its multi-cooker made a big splash, bringing pressure cookers back into regular usage. That cgadget is experiencing a notable sale&mdash;the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpxky?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%20Mini&amp;short_url=zjpxky&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Instant Pot Duo Mini</u></a> 7-in-1 is on sale for $59.99, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgBXG?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%20Plus%209-in-1&amp;short_url=QKgBXG&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1</u></a> is 50% off for $69.99. The Duo Plus has extra functionality and double the capacity, so unless you have serious storage constraints, it&rsquo;s worth the extra $10.</p><p>My favorite Instant appliance is their <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp75lZ?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Vortex%20six-quart%20basket%20air%20fryer&amp;short_url=Qp75lZ&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Vortex six-quart basket air fryer</u></a> and that&rsquo;s on sale right now for 29% off for $84.99. I love this machine&mdash;maybe too much. After testing multiple air fryers of different styles (you can <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-air-fryers" target="_blank"><u>see how they stack up</u></a> here), this one became my daily go-to machine. The Instant Vortex cooks evenly, it&rsquo;s powerful, ventilates well, and it&rsquo;s hands-down the easiest to clean. I&rsquo;ve literally taken one air fryer out, stared at it and put it back in the storage cabinet because I knew I&rsquo;d regret the mess. Instead, I&rsquo;d grab my trusty Vortex. You can read my full review of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/instant-vortex-air-fryer-review" target="_blank"><u>Instant Vortex air fryer here</u></a>&mdash;note that the one on sale right now is the newer generation with a larger digital display.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-use-a-rice-cooker" target="_blank"><u>simple rice cookers</u></a> that have a single switch and operate with a spring-loaded mechanism, but newer, sleeker rice cookers are all the rage. They&rsquo;re loaded with preset functions for other types of grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice and others), so you don&rsquo;t have to think about it so much. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z620Kk?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=The%20Instant%20Pot%20rice%20cooker&amp;short_url=z620Kk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">The Instant Pot rice cooker</a> is exactly this type of grain cooker with a sleek, clean design and easy to navigate menu of options.

            <description>It's the fastest way to capture fleeting thoughts.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adding things to Reminders on the iPhone necessitates several steps. You have to open the app, then find the relevant list, then enter the task. Sure, you can use Siri, but in my experience Siri makes mistakes, and I prefer to type things out. In the past, I&rsquo;ve used and recommended the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/use-this-app-to-solve-the-biggest-problem-with-apple-re-1848319244" target="_blank"><u>RemindMeFaster app</u></a>, which reduces the work required to one tap. Now, Apple has integrated that concept directly into iOS 26, leading to a superior (and faster) experience for adding tasks to the Reminders app.</p><p>iOS 26's New Reminder control can be added to the Control Center, Lock Screen, or the Action button. No matter where you trigger it, it brings up a quick entry system that floats above everything else, letting you add reminders with due dates, location, and the list of your choice. </p><h2 id="setting-up-the-new-quick-reminders-shortcut">Setting up the new quick reminders shortcut</h2><p>As mentioned above, you can add the New Reminder control to one of three new places. For fastest entry, you can choose the Lock Screen or Control Center option. </p><p>Open the Control Center, tap and hold in an empty area, and tap <strong>Add a Control</strong>. Now, search for and add the <strong>New Reminder</strong> control. You are then free to put it anywhere in the Control Center, and you can expand its size as well.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Similarly, go to the Lock screen, tap and hold the wallpaper, choose <strong>Customize</strong>, and then choose one the two <strong>Control</strong> buttons at the bottom. Switch it to the <strong>New Reminder control</strong>, and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p><p>To add it to the Action button, got to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Action Button</strong> &gt; <strong>Controls</strong> &gt; <strong>Choose a Control</strong> &gt; <strong>New Reminder</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve personally set the New Reminder toggle in Control Center, right at the bottom. I don&rsquo;t use any Action button actions, and I like to keep the Torch and Camera icons on the lock screen, so Control Center is the best option for me. </p><h2 id="using-the-new-quick-reminders-shortcut">Using the new quick reminders shortcut</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Now that the New Reminder control is front and center, it&rsquo;s time to test it out.</p><p>Tapping on it will reveal a new floating window on the top of the iPhone screen (this will work on iPad and Mac as well).</p><p>Here, you can tap on the dropdown icon to select a list&mdash;it will remember the list you used last, so you won&rsquo;t need to change it every single time. Next, type out the reminder, and you can even add notes here (pasting in notes works as expected). Then, you can use natural language to add a due date (e.g., typing &ldquo;tomorrow at 9 AM&rdquo; and then choosing the time from the suggestion bar). You an add a location, or Flag it as an important task. Then, tap the Checkmark icon to save the reminder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Music has <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/all-the-new-apple-music-features-in-ios-26-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">several new features in iOS 26</a>, but AutoMix is probably going to be the one you notice immediately. It lets the app seamlessly transition from one song to the next by using some of the tricks that a DJ might employ. You're going to notice that something is different about <a href="https://au.lifehacker.com/apple/114479/news/apple-music-can-now-translate-lyrics-dj-your-playlists-and-start-a-karaoke-session" target="_blank">Apple Music's track switching</a> right away because AutoMix is enabled by default. I've used it every day for three weeks now, and I have mixed feelings about it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-apple-musics-automix">What exactly is Apple Music's AutoMix?</h2><p>Apple says AutoMix uses AI to analyze audio features and "crafts unique transitions between songs with time stretching and beat matching to deliver continuous playback and an even more seamless listening experience." This is basically what a DJ does when they're performing live. It could be cool to have your own personal DJ built into your streaming service, but the results in Apple Music vary from quite good to totally off-putting.</p><h2 id="why-automix-is-a-mixed-bag">Why AutoMix is a mixed bag</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Whether you go to a club or a live concert, most good DJs will obsess over details such as track order, the vibe of the room, what kind of a mood they're going for, and much more. This means that your friendly neighborhood DJ is thinking a lot about the kind of experience you want to have and it's a delicate balance between raising the energy of the room high enough to get everyone dancing, but not so high that everyone's exhausted within 15 minutes. They'd also consider giving people a short breather with mellow songs so that people can take a breath and get refreshments. The best DJs will read the room and ensure that you have a good time.</p><p>AutoMix sometimes feels like it's a really good DJ who's made the perfect set list just for you. When it works well, tracks blend into one another and you never feel out of place. I am a fan of continuous playback, and when it works, AutoMix delivers spectacularly. However, unlike a good DJ, AutoMix doesn't care much for track order and tries to blend songs no matter what. If you have a high-energy song followed by a slower one, AutoMix will slow down the end of the fast song so that it matches the beat of the slower one coming next. It also speeds up slow songs when the next track is a faster one, which sounds comically bad at times. </p><p>Personally, I don't want to listen to music at 0.75x or 1.5x speeds, unless I'm specifically seeking out a workout mix. AutoMix aggressively applies its beat-matching algorithm to every transition and really draws attention to itself. In its current state, AutoMix is a bit too aggressive on certain transitions, and I hope Apple tones it down in the days leading up to iOS 26's stable release this fall.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a useful feature for certain types of playlists where tracks have a similar "vibe," but it struggles when your playlists have wildly varying types of songs. I have a habit of curating playlists carefully, so that the sounds at the end of a song match those at the beginning of the next one, and AutoMix didn't work well with any of those playlists. By blending the end of one track with the start of the next, AutoMix undid a lot of my hard work. I honestly wouldn't mind using it with playlists that I automatically play on shuffle mode, but not with personally curated playlists. The good thing is that Apple has disabled AutoMix for albums and "some genres," so you don't have to worry about AI ruining your favorite masterpieces.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-or-disable-automix-in-apple-music">How to enable or disable AutoMix in Apple Music</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Fortunately, it's quite easy to enable or disable AutoMix in<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-finally-adds-pins-to-apple-music" target="_blank"> iOS 26</a>. For starters, you can turn AutoMix on or off by opening the Music app and tapping the mini player that displays the currently playing song. Once the player expands, tap the three lines button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This reveals the <strong>Continue Playing</strong> screen that shows the song queue. Above the track list, you'll see four buttons: <strong>Shuffle</strong>, <strong>Repeat</strong>, <strong>Autoplay</strong> (the infinity symbol), and <strong>AutoMix</strong> (the two circles button). You can tap the <strong>AutoMix</strong> button to toggle it.</p><p>If you're permanently done with Apple Music's AutoMix feature <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/all-the-ios-26-features-apple-barely-mentioned-at-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">in iOS 26</a>, here's how to get rid of it. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Music &gt; Song Transitions</strong>, and disable <strong>Song Transitions</strong>. This will let songs play out normally. If you'd rather keep gapless playback without the AI DJ, then you can keep Song Transitions enabled, and select <strong>Crossfade</strong> on the same page. Apple lets you pick the duration of the crossfade, which you might prefer over AutoMix.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> didn't invent its style of deadly competitive hijinks, which was first popularized way back in 2000 in Kinji Fukasaku's kids-killing-kids action fest <em>Battle Royale</em>, but it's certainly been smarter and sharper in its social satire, as well as buzzier: toys, games, Halloween costumes, and more have all sprung from the <em>Squid Game</em> font. (Interesting that we can't even enjoy a brutal takedown of late-stage capitalism without running out to buy some merch.)</p><p>With <em>Squid Game</em> currently at an end (at least until the potential <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/squid-game-david-fincher-tv-series-1236159538/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">David Fincher-led reboot</a>), and with a year or so to go until the next <em>Hunger Games </em>movie, you might be on the hunt for a new high-stakes obsession. Here are 10 possibilities. (Just try to enjoy them while they're fictional: The United States Department of Homeland Security is reportedly considering an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/homeland-security-immigration-reality-show.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">immigration reality show</a> in which refugees would compete for green cards, so we're already rather impressively close to a real-life <em>Squid Game</em>.)</p><hr><h2 id="the-8-show-2024-miniseries"><em>The 8 Show</em> (2024, miniseries)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video">

<p>A premise that might have seemed excessively on-the-nose a decade ago now looks like a reasonably good distillation of our current capitalist hellscape&mdash;and generally, South Korean TV shows and movies have been ahead of the curve when it comes to addressing the exploitative nature of late-stage capitalism. Here, eight strangers are selected to compete in a game in which they're locked together in a building and sequestered on different floors each night. They earn money for each minute they last in the game, but all their provisions must be purchased with money they've won, at an extreme markup. At first, the contestants pool their resources so that everyone gets more money&mdash;until they learn that people on higher floors are getting more. Then things get nasty. <strong>You can stream <em>The 8 Show</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81719583" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>It would be tempting to see this as a metaphor for the American dream but, of course, it&rsquo;s a Brazilian show, and it&rsquo;s not as though inequality was invented in the United States&mdash;we&rsquo;re just particularly good at it. In <em>3%</em>, the impoverished young Inlanders have one shot at success: completing &ldquo;The Process,&rdquo; a series of interviews, puzzles, and escape rooms designed to test their worthiness to join a futuristic offshore utopia. Most fail, and many don&rsquo;t survive, leaving a success rate of...3%. This is very much <em>Hunger Games</em> territory, but the show has a darker, more adult edge. It also has four seasons in which to develop its characters and mythology, allowing it to dig a bit deeper than some of its YA contemporaries. <strong>You can stream <em>3%</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80074184" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot here that&rsquo;s familiar. A group of teens from a small Texas town compete in the annual competition of the title&mdash;a host of TV-attractive teenagers competing in a series of dangerous stunts. The primary innovation, as in the Lauren Oliver novel on which the show is based (she&rsquo;s also the writer and show runner) are the stakes: They&rsquo;re atypically low, and that's very much the point. Most of the other shows and movies on this list built tension by dangling dramatically big prizes before starry-eyed contestants. Here, the winner gets just $50,000 for engaging in a series of life-threatening stunts&mdash;indeed, as the series opens, two people had died the previous year, and the current year&rsquo;s Panic won&rsquo;t be without casualties. It&rsquo;s good money, but it&rsquo;s not exactly going to set anyone up for life, and it&rsquo;s not nearly enough to inspire the town&rsquo;s better-situated kids to get involved. For some, it represents a shot at moving out of town, or going to college&mdash;dreams well beyond most of the participants. While the richer kids kids go about their lives, the poor kids fight over scraps. <strong>You can stream <em>Panic</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbvGp?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QdbvGp&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Stepping away from the "deadly games" genre, <em>All of Us Are Dead</em> is, instead, a zombie thriller. Here, high school is hell, almost literally, as a viral outbreak sees a school become ground zero for a strange plague. Though it's not clear at first, the teenagers soon realize that they've been quarantined from the rest of the city. Help isn't coming. Nihilism isn't uncommon in zombie narratives, nor are themes involving the breakdown of social structures. <em>All of Us Are Dead</em>, instead, explores the world of a cloistered high school under constant threat as a parallel to our own world: Class and background continue to be potent forces, even (or especially) amid the trauma of the attacks, and arbitrary social hierarchies solidify under the constant trauma rather than adapt. The closed school location is brilliantly utilized, and there's some appropriately soapy drama, as well. Look for <em>Squid Game</em>'s Emmy-winner Lee Yoo-mi as spoiled rich kid Lee Na-yeon. <strong>You can stream <em>All of Us Are Dead</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81237994" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

</div>


<p>In a sign of our streaming times, <em>The Wilds</em> was a buzzy, unexpected hit for Prime Video in its first season, only to lose viewership after taking a two-year break. The show works as a YA version of <em>Lost</em>&mdash;including a slightly ridiculous scenario involving a plane crash&mdash;with characters who get more engaging as the show goes along. Situated between flashbacks and flash-forwards, an airplane full of teenage girls from different places crashes on the way to an empowerment program in Hawaii. It quickly becomes clear that the accident was engineered, and that the whole thing is some sort of social experiment, forcing the survivors to compete against each other for survival. The show&rsquo;s smart enough to understand the ways in which young women in the real-world are exploited and expected to compete against each other, which grounds the elaborate plot twists. <strong>You can stream <em>The Wilds</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXqLN?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QVXqLN&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Video-game obsessed Arisu gets his wish, after a fashion, when he finds himself, along with a couple of friends, transported to an alternate, eerily abandoned version of Tokyo&mdash;the title&rsquo;s Borderland&mdash;vividly brought to life via some clever green screen work. The three are directed to an arena and given the instructions for the game, which they&rsquo;ll be playing whether they want to or not. The first competition involves a locked-room-style puzzle; if they fail, the room goes up in flames with them in it&mdash;think <em>Ready Player One</em>, with deadlier stakes. There are games each night, though the rules allow for winners to get time off...there are a lot of rules, actually, but the games are cleverly and sadistically constructed. It&rsquo;s been renewed for a third season, coming in September. <strong>You can stream <em>Alice in Borderland</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80200575" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though it initially feels like an unnecessarily extended imitation of Bong Joon Ho's allegorical post-apocalyptic film, the show quickly takes on a life of its own as a clever sci-fi melodrama, smartly recognizing that there are no heroes and few true villains at the end of the world&mdash;mostly just people doing whatever they can to survive. In a frozen future (2026 to be precise), humanity survives on an<em> extremely long</em> train that circumnavigates the globe. If it were ever to sop, everyone dies. Those who came aboard with wealth live near the front in relative luxury, while the poor live on scraps in the train's tail. Daveed Diggs stars as former detective Andre Layton, a Tailie deputized by Jennifer Connelly's Melanie Cavill, engineer and the train's Head of Hospitality, to solve a series of murders. The inevitable uprising that follows sees the two of them on different sides of a violent conflict, before each realizes they're being manipulated by others. <strong>You can stream <em>Snowpiercer</em> on AMC+ or buy episodes from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGg23Y?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=QGg23Y&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p><em>The Purge</em> film series has always projected a high-minded veneer of social allegory over what are, in essence, exploitation-style home invasion thrillers. The series exists in much the same vein, tying in to the movies while also serving as an entry point. Here, we meet former Marine Miguel (Gabriel Chavarria), whose sister Penelope (Jessica Garza) has joined up with a Purge-adjacent cult. Jane (Amanda Warren) is spending the Purge night holed up in her office trying to get some work done for her boss (William Baldwin); a couple of real estate developers are attending a Purge Night gala hoping for an investment from an ultra-wealthy oligarch (Reed Diamond). The disparate stories come together over the course of several episodes that also dig into franchise mythology a little more deeply than in the films. <strong>You can stream <em>The Purge</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnKoK?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=aRnKoK&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hulu</a></strong><strong> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgBWp?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Peacock&amp;short_url=aAgBWp&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Peacock</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>People in deep debt are given the opportunity to play deadly versions of children's games against other players, with the hope of getting enough cash to pay their bills. Sound familiar? Though it's from another country and a different decade, the anime <em>Kaiji</em> is about as close as you're likely to come to <em>Squid Game</em>'s brand of darkly satirical thrills. (<em>Squid Game</em> creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has cited the original manga <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/squid-game-creator-season-2-meaning-1235030617/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">as an influence</a>.) Kaiji It&#333; is a gambler who's lost everything when he's approached by a loan shark to participate in a highly secretive offshore gambling event. He'll compete in events, including a lethal version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors," while others gamble on him and his competitors for their amusement. <strong>You can stream <em>Kaiji</em> on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G6GGV5WW6/kaiji" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Crunchyroll</a></strong><strong> and HIDIVE or rent episodes from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgByX?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=aDgByX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Seo In-guk stars as Choi Yee-jae, a young man who gives up on life after years of being unable to find work, eventually resolving to end his own life. Death (Park So-dam) isn't at all impressed by his cavalier attitude&mdash;in fact, she's pissed, and sentences him to experience a dozen lives on the brink of death before she drags him to hell. First he's a powerful heir, then a bullied highs school student, then a neglected child, etc. Think <em>Quantum Leap</em>, but with more dying. Experiencing lives (and deaths) through the eyes of others, Yee-jae comes to realize that he'd prefer to live, thank you very much and, further, if he can save the life of anyone he enters, he'll be able to stay. <strong>You can stream <em>Death's Game</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRJdD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=9wRJdD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Scroll through FitTok (aka "Fitness TikTok") and you'll inevitably <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/exercise-vibrations-plate?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">stumble across</a> someone standing on what looks like a large, vibrating platform, promising it's the secret to effortless fitness. These vibration plates are a relentless wellness trend, with influencers claiming they'll transform your body with minimal effort. Lifehacker's senior health editor Beth Skwarecki has <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-myth-of-the-week-vibration-plates-1850548917" target="_blank">previously debunked</a> those claims. "Minimal effort" is a timeless marketing gimmick, one that gets constantly repackaged for new audiences. And don't these vibration plates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkHgZpYLpHI&amp;t=4s" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">seem familiar</a>? Are we not just reliving the same scams from the 1950s?</p><p>So, let's say we all agree that vibration plates aren't going to lead to effortless weight loss. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-myth-of-the-week-vibration-plates-1850548917" target="_blank">We know that</a> there isn't any research strong enough to back up claims that vibration plates help you gain muscle or lose fat. The thing is, that's not the only tactic being used to sell vibration plates. In fact, many of the companies marketing these vibration plates don't even bother with weight loss claims&mdash;that's the TikTok creators <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marralpn/video/7442470838542126367?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">doing</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@liveyounglifestyle/video/7311802512489680170?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">it</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@over50kelly/video/7464981807641922862?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">for</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wildandalmostfree/video/7443891562100165918?lang=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">them</a>. Instead, I see these devices <em>officially</em> marketed for alternative purposes, like lymphatic drainage, bone strength, or better balance. If you ask me, those types of holistic claims sound a lot more believable. After all, what's so different between a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-and-where-to-use-each-massage-gun-head" target="_blank">massage gun</a> and vibrating plate?</p><p>I wanted to test those claims personally, so I've secured myself one of the most popular ones sold on TikTok: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbJWj?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Merach%20whole%20body%20vibration%20plate&amp;short_url=QdbJWj&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Merach whole body vibration plate</a>. Before you too add one to your cart in TikTok Shop, let's examine what these devices actually do&mdash;and more importantly, what they don't.</p><h2 id="what-are-vibration-plates-exactly">What are vibration plates, exactly?</h2><p>Vibration plates are exactly what they sound like: flat surfaces that vibrate at various frequencies and amplitudes. When you stand on one, the rapid vibrations force your muscles to contract reflexively as your body works to maintain balance and stability. </p><p>The vibrations typically range from 15 to 50 Hz (cycles per second), which I would describe as "nothing too crazy." You can use them passively, simply standing or sitting on the platform while you brush your teeth. The theory is that these involuntary muscle contractions could provide some of the benefits of traditional exercise. Or you can perform exercises like squats or push-ups while the device vibrates beneath you&mdash;the theory being that you're adding to the intensity of your workout to get better results. </p><h2 id="what-does-vibration-actually-do-for-you">What does vibration actually do for you?</h2><p>Let's start with that last claim, that being vibrated automatically makes your workouts better. While your muscles do contract during the vibrating experience, these aren't the same type of contractions that build substantial strength or burn meaningful calories. The logic that "harder equals more effective" is fundamentally flawed. Yes, it might be more challenging to perform squats while being vibrated, but it would also be harder to do squats if I were throwing garbage at your head&mdash;that doesn't make it more beneficial. <em>Difficulty</em> doesn't translate to <em>superior results</em>. In general, any device that claims to "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gilbert_chronicles/video/7459982984410631467?q=vibration%20plate&amp;t=1740074559193" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">do the work for you</a>"should immediately raise a red flag. If weights did the work for you, you wouldn't get stronger. If treadmills did the work for you, you wouldn't get faster. Unfortunately, "the work" is where your fitness comes from. </p><p>Outside of weight loss claims, I've seen plenty of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1fs5t47/tiktokers_are_touting_vibration_plates_for_health/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Exercise/comments/1dz9ppb/what_are_the_benefits_of_a_vibration_plate/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">comments</a> arguing in defense of vibration plates. I agree that the vibrations can feel like a massage. I enjoy stepping on my vibration plate to "shake out" after a run, and I even like how the vibrations feel on my brain when I'm trying to relax at the end of the day. Unfortunately, any research to actually back up these holistic benefits is simply <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/well/vibration-plates-weight-loss.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">too inconsistent and limited</a> right now. </p><p>Dr. Kira Capozzolo, a chiropractor and founder of <a href="https://twinwaveswellness.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Twin Waves Wellness Center</a>, frequently fields questions about vibration plates from her patients. Regarding muscle recovery, Dr. Capozzolo explains that while she's seen some studies suggest that whole body vibration can mildly improve circulation, reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness, and even activate muscle fibers, "it's not a magic bullet." She describes vibration plates as "more of a recovery booster, not a replacement for proper rest, hydration, or mobility work." </p><p><a href="https://www.mentalhealthmassage.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Carrie Riley</a>, a Certified Manual Lymphatic Drainage Therapist (C-MLD), echoes similar sentiments: "It should be viewed as a complement to movement, not a magic fix." Regarding lymphatic benefits, Riley explains the mechanism, but tempers expectations: "Lymph flow relies on muscle contractions and diaphragmatic breathing. Some studies suggest vibration might help stimulate lymphatic flow through micro-contractions of muscles as the body tries to maintain balance. Still, it's not a substitute for targeted lymphatic drainage work." For healthy users, there might be a mild benefit. But for post-op clients or people dealing with chronic inflammation, it's often too general to make a meaningful difference, and in some cases, it could even be a bad fit.</p><p>The bottom line is that if any of the TikTok creators actually believe what they're saying about vibration plates, it's most likely placebo. The science is not on their side. </p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>Despite the lack of dramatic fitness benefits, it's clear that many people who try vibration plates enjoy the general experience. They feel some sort of benefit beyond weight loss or muscle building. These subjective benefits, while not scientifically earth-shattering, might still have value for some individuals.</p><p>At the end of the day, vibration plates aren't the fitness revolution that TikTok makes them out to be. They won't replace proper exercise, dramatically reshape your body, or serve as a shortcut to health. However, they may offer modest benefits for muscle recovery when used as part of a broader wellness routine, and some people simply enjoy how they feel.</p><p>If you're considering a vibration plate, approach it with realistic expectations. Think of it as a potential recovery tool or relaxation device rather than a fitness game-changer. And remember: If something sounds too good to be true on social media, it probably is.</p><p><em>Author's Note: I'm currently in the middle of a 60-day test where I use a vibration plate daily. Stay tuned for my findings on what these devices actually do when used consistently in real-world conditions.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re planting a garden and need some watering equipment or have some trimming to do, a good set of tools can help you make light work of your outdoor chore list. But getting the right tools and equipment for your outdoor chores can be expensive. Here are my favorite 4th of July deals from Home Depot on outdoor gear to keep your projects on budget.</p><h2 id="trimming-and-cutting">Trimming and cutting</h2><p>Cutting branches back from exterior walls can lengthen the life of your siding, limit damage from moisture, and make your home more fire resistant, so trimming and cutting tools are essential for good landscaping maintenance. In addition to the practical advantages of trimming your various flora, it can also make everything look a lot nicer. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

That said, I can't deny that they're useful in some circumstances, including for clearing leaves and grass clippings from sidewalk pavement, preventing slippery spots when it rains. If you have a need for a leaf blower, cordless ones are lighter, quieter, and cheaper to run than their gas-powered alternatives. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

            <description>"Connectivity Labs" lets you do more with your networks.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having spent more than two decades writing about gadgets and tech in general, it's not often that I come across a feature that I've never seen or heard of before&mdash;but Samsung has surprised me. It turns out the device maker has hidden a rather useful wifi menu in its One UI software that gives you a whole bunch of useful options. It's definitely new to me, and it might be new to you, too.</p><p>I'm indebted to the fine folks at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-phones-secret-wi-fi-settings-connectivity-labs-how-enable-3570045/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Android Authority</a> for spotting it; they, in turn, discovered it via a thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1lfwl4k/hidden_wifi_settings/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>, which embedded a TikTok video.The feature is called Connectivity Labs, and it seems to have been added at some point in 2023. You'll find it under the Intelligent Wi-Fi settings that Samsung makes available for the networks you connect to.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-connectivity-labs">How to enable Connectivity Labs</h2><p>Here's how to enable it: Open Settings on your Galaxy phone, then tap <strong>Connections &gt; Wi-Fi</strong>. Tap the three dots up in the top right corner, then choose <strong>Intelligent Wi-Fi</strong>. You'll see some handy options here for switching wifi networks, connecting to hotspots, detecting suspicious networks, and prioritizing real time data.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ09X0Y02HJH148PM2E1E4Z6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751283303.jpg" alt="Connectivity Labs" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ09X0Y02HJH148PM2E1E4Z6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1751283303.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ09X0Y02HJH148PM2E1E4Z6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1751283303.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JZ09X0Y02HJH148PM2E1E4Z6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751283303.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">The Connectivity Labs screen is packed with options.</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>To find the hidden menu, you need to <strong>tap Intelligent Wi-Fi at the bottom of the screen seven times</strong> to enable <strong>Connectivity Labs</strong> (when you get close, you'll see a message telling you that the feature is about to be enabled). That then gives you an extra Connectivity Labs menu option on this screen. The menu button describes the feature as being "for internal test purposes." </p><h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-connectivity-labs">What you can do with Connectivity Labs</h2><p>Tab Connectivity Labs and you'll first see a stack of statistics about your phone's wifi connection over the last week, including how much data you've used, how much time you've been connected, and even which wifi bands and standards you've been using (this can help you make sure you're getting full use of your new Wi-Fi 7 tri-band router).</p><p>Further down you'll find a range of options and toggle switches. One setting of note is <strong>Switching to mobile data faster</strong>, which should mean your phone is quicker to ditch a shaky wifi network for cellular data, and may be preferable if you've got an unlimited data plan for your handset.</p><p>Then there's <strong>Auto reconnect to carrier Wi-Fi</strong>, which apparently fully automates the process of connecting to public wifi spots provided by your carrier. Whether you want this to happen or not is really going to be down to personal preference and how you want your phone to work, but it's helpful to have the option.</p><p>Tap <strong>Customize Wi-Fi list settings</strong> and you're able to make improvements to the list of available wifi networks you see on your phone. You can change the signal strength threshold that determines whether or not a wifi network is shown as available, for example, and set up more filters to control which networks you see (maybe you only want to see secured, 5 GHz networks, for example).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">You can check the strength of the wifi around your home.</span>
                                        <span class="text-xs inline-block text-gray-600">Credit: Lifehacker</span>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Choose <strong>Wi-Fi developer options</strong> for even more stats, including a <strong>Nearby Wi-Fi information</strong> screen that ranks the networks around you based on the quality of their signal strength, from worst to best. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems and for making sure devices are connected to the network with the best signal.</p><p>Speaking of checking signal strength, if you open the <strong>Home Wi-Fi inspection</strong> option from the Connectivity Labs page, you get taken step by step through the process of seeing how good the wifi is at various points around your home. You pick the network you want to analyze, then wander around with your phone to check its strength at various points. Again, it's handy for figuring out why your laptop might be losing connection in the bedroom, or finding the best spot to install your new security camera. </p><p>Taken together, all of the tools in Connectivity Labs are so useful, it's something of a surprise that Samsung has placed them in a hidden menu you can't see by default. I'mglad to have discovered it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta is prompting users to grant ongoing access to their camera roll photos&mdash;including media they haven't specifically uploaded to Facebook&mdash;in order to receive AI-edited and curated images and suggestions for "creative ideas." </p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As TechCrunch reports</a>, Meta is currently testing a feature that leads to some Facebook users seeing a pop-up requesting permission for "cloud processing." The message appears when users attempt to create a new Story on Facebook and, if agreed to, would permit Meta to upload media from your device to its servers on an "ongoing basis" in order to suggest collages, recaps, or AI restyling. </p><p>As we've written, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-keep-your-meta-ai-questions-private" target="_blank">Meta AI is among the absolute worst</a> when it comes to privacy and security. (Meta in general has <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-apps-have-been-covertly-tracking-android-users-web-activity-for-months" target="_blank">a questionable history</a> with protecting user data.) If you allow Meta access to your camera roll for image processing, you agree to Meta's AI terms, which include the right to analyze your media and facial features and "retain and use" personal information you've shared.  </p><p>While Facebook has said the feature is a test, the ability to opt into giving Meta access to your photos doesn't seem to be brand new. You <em>can</em> enable it in your Facebook settings, as it's off by default, but you probably shouldn't, and you should decline the pop-up prompt if you don't want to hand more data over to Meta. </p><h2 id="how-to-manage-your-meta-ai-photo-permissions">How to manage your Meta AI photo permissions</h2><p>If you see the pop-up on Facebook, you can tap <strong>Don't allow</strong> to block the AI suggestion feature from accessing your camera roll. You can ensure it is disabled in your Facebook app settings: Go to the Menu by tapping your profile photo followed by the Settings icon. Scroll to Camera roll sharing suggestions and check that <strong>Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing</strong> is toggled off. </p><p>You should also take this opportunity to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-should-double-check-which-apps-can-see-your-iphone-photos" target="_blank">audit which apps have access</a> to your photo library and revoke any permissions that aren't absolutely necessary for the app's primary functionality. While these permissions may be mostly innocuous, there are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/never-keep-private-information-screenshots-on-phone" target="_blank">malware campaigns that target sensitive information</a> found in your photos and screenshots. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>There are a surprising number of meditation apps available in virtual reality, and I am their target demographic. I want to make progress down the Noble Eightfold Path, and/or experience the reduction in stress and other benefits that <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">come from meditation</a>. On the other hand, I find meditation tedious, and I think I can get the same relaxation benefits from sitting in a dark room and listening to Hawkwind anyway. But maybe VR is the answer? I checked out a bunch of VR meditation apps to see whether they might be helpful, and rated each on a scale from 1 (wandering ego trapped in the prison of the self) to 5 (liberation from the cycle of suffering and rebirth).</p><h2 id="first-an-expert-weighs-in">First, an expert weighs in </h2><p>I know a lot about VR, but less about meditation, so I talked it out with <a href="https://shawnathibodeau.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Shawna Thibodeau</a>, a meditation teacher and spiritual mentor. She explained that there are different schools of meditation, and her description of "concentrative meditation" sounds a lot like what the VR experiences I've tried are going for. "With concentrative meditation, we're focusing our attention on what's called an anchor, like the breath," Thibodeau said. "When you focus your attention on something other than your thoughts, you start to gain awareness into your thoughts. And then, with every time that you come back to your anchor, you're training your mind to come into the present moment."</p><p>But there's a strong obstacle between the VR meditation applications I've seen and most traditional forms of meditation: visuals. If you're starting transcendental meditation, say, step 2 (right after "sit in a comfortable position") is "close your eyes." But Reality doesn't Virtual with your eyes closed. According to Thibodeau, visualization/manifestation meditations might be better suited to the virtual world: </p><p>"What we're doing there is shifting the state of energy that we're sitting in...the state of energy we're sitting in actually influences reality," Thibodeau explained. "If you're sitting in a state of abundance or expansion, that energy will start to influence your outer reality, and you can actually see changes in your outer world. Synchronicities can come to you, new opportunities, and your life can actually start to shift in a really interesting and kind of magical way."</p><p> I asked Thibodeau to visualize a VR meditation app that used that kind of practice, and she said: "There'd have to be a visual that basically helps you get into that elevated state, right? So I don't know, maybe they could show you like winning the lottery, and then it prompts you to be like, 'how does this make you feel? Get into that state.'"</p><p>Leaving aside the efficacy of meditating for manifestation, it does seem better suited to the virtual world than traditional meditation, but it also seems like virtual reality (and video games) already put people in a state where they are fully engrossed in an experience they presumably want to manifest: most video games are power fantasies. Whether that power manifests in the real world is a bigger question. </p><h2 id="tripp">Tripp</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video">

It encompasses a ton of experiences designed to get users to practice mindfulness, improve focus, or enter a state of &ldquo;calm,&rdquo; There are guided meditations, visual breathing trainers, psychedelic &ldquo;focus journeys,&rdquo; and trippy abstract visuals that pulse and swirl, all wrapped in a new-age-meets-techbro aesthetic that's heavy on implied drugs. Some of the experiences are directly inspired by psychedelic experiences&mdash;there's a series called "Machine Elves" that is clearly based on DMT visuals, and the app itself nods toward that vibe in its marketing, with references to &ldquo;inner space,&rdquo; &ldquo;expanded states,&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital psychedelics.&rdquo; A lot of people love Tripp, but it felt overwhelming to me. The sessions were slick, but it left me &ldquo;zen-adjacent&rdquo; at best. It's meant to be calming, but it amplified my inner critic. It's like taking drugs without <em>feeling</em> like you're taking drugs, if that makes sense.

It features five 10-minute "experiences" designed to deliver mental clarity, calm the mind, and "renew your body through healing sound frequencies." In practice, this involves a soothing voice telling you to chill and just sit there, droning "music" (I really can't stand the music that is synonymous with spiritually colored relaxation) and graphics of caves, volcanoes, and other natural things that look like they're out of <em>Minecraft</em>. It's relaxing, I guess, but mostly because "relaxing" and "boring" are practically roommates.

It seems like "awe" and "energy" are the most popular and feature some cool tech demos/mini-games, but I was interested in "calm," where the meditative mini-games are. The ones I tried weren't particularly groundbreaking. One was supposed to hypnotize me, but didn't.

It tracks how far your belly expands and contracts as you breathe. Deeper breaths from the diaphragm make you move faster through semi-abstract landscapes.

Pillow is played lying on your back in bed, already a more relaxing experience than other apps. Among its five mini-games (called "dreams") is "the Meditator,"  the best meditation app I tried overall. It uses the same controller-as-breath-monitor as Flowborne VR, but the soundtrack features chill little indie loops instead of weird drones. So much better. Another standout from Pillow: "The Fisherman," an experience that lets you reel in virtual fish from your ceiling. Each fish contains the recorded voice of another user of Pillow answering a question like "What would you most like to do in your life?" or "What moment would you like to relive?" I found that connecting with the thoughts of a fellow human while drifting off to sleep to be way more meaningful/spiritual than being told to stare at outdated graphics and imagine connectedness. It's show, instead of tell, and $9.99 is a small price to pay for such a strangely beautiful experience.</p><p><strong>Best for:</strong> chill weirdos and insomniacs</p><p><strong>Enlighten-o-meter score</strong>: 4 out of 5</p>]]></content:encoded>

                Doesn’t)</title>

            <description>Advanced Protection offers Android's strongest security—possibly more than
                some users need.</description>
            <media:thumbnail
                url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYSBC36JA7FHG1R6GCW12GJ5/hero-image.png" />
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Android users got <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-android-show-new-security-features-google" target="_blank">a whole host of security and privacy upgrades</a> with the release of Android 16, including expanded in-call scam protection, live threat detection for malicious apps, and more. These features are well worth enabling, as they'll help secure your data and your device against theft, malware, and phishing attacks. Google also extended its Advanced Protection Program to include stricter device-level features aimed at reducing the risk of compromise. </p><p>Advanced Protection offers the most robust all-around security available on Android under a single setting&mdash;an incredibly useful tool for journalists, activists, and anyone with access to sensitive data that could be targeted by threat actors. Those who are especially privacy- and security-minded may also want to enable Advanced Protection, while the average user should weigh how this feature fits with their security needs. </p><h2 id="how-advanced-protection-works-on-android-16">How Advanced Protection works on Android 16</h2><p>Advanced Protection makes strong security the default on your Android 16 device by enabling certain features and disabling the ability to turn off others. It also includes new protections, like automatically rebooting your device if it remains locked for 72 hours, encrypting your data behind biometrics or your PIN. Additionally, your device won't be able to automatically reconnect to unsecured wifi networks, and USB access will be blocked when your phone is locked.</p><p>Advanced Protect automatically enables security features like theft detection, HTTPS on Chrome for all website connections, and scam and spam protection in Messages. All of these can be turned on individually in your device settings, but Advanced Protection does so in one fell swoop. It will also prevent you from turning off Google Play Protect and Android Safe Browsing, which keep you from downloading malicious apps and accessing malicious websites on your device. </p><p>The potential downsides of Advanced Protection include limits on side-loading apps&mdash;you'll only be able to download from approved sources like the Google Play Store&mdash;and the likelihood that some websites will break thanks to the disabling of the JavaScript optimizer on Chrome. (Note that you should be extremely wary of downloading apps from unofficial sources anyway, as these can be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/never-keep-private-information-screenshots-on-phone" target="_blank">vectors for spreading malware</a>.) </p><p>Advanced Protection is comparable to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-lockdown-mode-on-ios-16-and-macos-ventura-1849179969" target="_blank">Apple's Lockdown Mode for iOS</a>, which blocks certain app and web features as well as setting changes that could be used to spread malware. Even Apple has said that Lockdown Mode is "an extreme, optional protection" aimed at high-risk users who may be personally targeted by cyberattacks, not meant for the average person. </p><p>So, should you use Advanced Protection? As <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/googles-advanced-protection-arrives-android-should-you-use-it" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the folks over at the Electronic Frontier Foundation write</a>, "there's no harm in giving it a try." It's easy to enable and disable, and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-advanced-protection-hands-on-3569651/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">you may not notice any impact</a> on your device (while getting the benefit of stronger security measures running in the background). You can always turn it off if it does restrict your day-to-day activities, knowing that it's probably overkill for some users. And you can still have Google Play Protect enabled along with other individual Android 16 security features and follow best practices for protecting your device from cyber threats. </p><h2 id="how-to-enable-advanced-protection">How to enable Advanced Protection</h2><p>To turn Advanced Protection on for your Android 16 device, open your <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Security &amp; privacy &gt; Advanced Protection</strong>. Flip the toggle next to <strong>Device protection</strong> and tap <strong>Turn on</strong>. You'll then have to restart your device for Advanced Protection to activate and run. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Mountain bikers, listen up: Garmin recently launched its latest cycling computer specifically tailored for you. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYvjA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=The%20Edge%20MTB&amp;short_url=QWYvjA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">The Edge MTB</a> is designed to meet the unique needs of off-road riders.</p><p>For context, the Edge MTB represents a departure from Garmin's traditional one-size-fits-all approach to cycling computers. This device focuses pretty exclusively on mountain biking scenarios, incorporating specialized tracking modes and trail-specific functionality that road cyclists would never need.</p><p>Here's how the Edge MTB works, and what sets it apart from other cycling computers.</p><h2 id="profiles-for-different-riding-styles">Profiles for different riding styles</h2><p>The computer introduces two distinct ride profiles designed for different mountain biking disciplines. The "enduro" profile recognizes that mountain biking involves both climbing and descending phases, allowing riders to track these segments independently. Users can manually switch between climb and descent tracking with a button press, or rely on the automatic pause feature to handle the transitions.</p><p>The "downhill" profile addresses a common frustration among gravity-focused riders: the need to constantly pause and resume recording when using chairlifts or shuttle services. (Huge for us <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/strava-privacy-issues" target="_blank">dual Strava-Garmin users</a>). This mode intelligently filters out uphill travel that isn't pedaled, so that only actual descent time and statistics are recorded. This eliminates the tedious ritual of manually pausing the device every time riders board a lift or hop in a shuttle vehicle.</p><h2 id="better-gps-for-winding-trails">Better GPS for winding trails</h2><p>Both specialized profiles utilize 5 Hz GPS recording, providing more frequent position updates than standard cycling computers. This higher sampling rate translates to improved accuracy when tracking the technical, winding paths typical of mountain bike trails.</p><p>The device also introduces virtual gates functionality, enabling riders to set checkpoint markers along trails to monitor split times across specific segments&mdash;useful for training or comparing performance on familiar routes.</p><h2 id="trail-navigation-features">Trail navigation features</h2><p>The Edge MTB comes equipped with <a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=P01Lqy8vUY84LonexcjNE9" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Forksight</a>, which displays approaching trail names as riders navigate through trail networks. The device ships with preloaded <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Trailforks</a> maps, giving users immediate access to trail information <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-watches-may-have-premium-health-subscription-fees-soon" target="_blank">without requiring additional downloads or subscriptions</a>.</p><h2 id="other-features-and-specs">Other features and specs</h2><p><a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/sports-fitness/meet-edge-mtb-garmins-first-ever-bike-computer-made-for-mountain-bikers/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">According to Garmin</a>, the Edge MBT's battery performance reaches 14 hours of standard operation, extending to 26 hours with battery saver mode. It has a scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass display and an IPX7 water resistance rating. Safety features include LiveTrack sharing and automatic incident detection.</p><p>The Edge MTB is available for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWeG4?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=%24399.99&amp;short_url=9YWeG4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">$399.99</a>, making it a mid-range option among Garmin's cycling computer lineup. Mountain bikers are sure to appreciate a computer that does more than simply treat off-road cycling as simply road cycling in a different environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>One more place online is about to have AI answers. At least for now, you
                have to ask for this one.</description>
            <media:thumbnail

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tide rises, the sun sets, and Google pushes AI summaries onto yet another product. This time, it's YouTube that's getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COYibrEk54" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>the AI Overview treatment</u></a>. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video">
    <div id="video-container-6COYibrEk54"></div>
</div>


<p>The new feature will add "carousels" of clips that AI determines are relevant to the top of certain searches. For now, the feature is only available to a very (<em>very</em>) narrow set of users.</p><p>It's a similar feature to the one you've probably seen in Google Search. Typically, if Google finds a YouTube video with a relevant portion to your search, it will present a highlighted clip that you can watch without leaving Google itself. These new YouTube AI carousels are populated with many of these relevant clips, and are paired with generative AI text summaries of the clips.</p><h2 id="how-to-turn-on-youtubes-ai-overviews">How to turn on YouTube's AI overviews </h2><p>Currently, AI-powered carousels are an experimental feature, only available to YouTube Premium subscribers in the United States, and only when you use search on an Android or iOS mobile device. If you want to enable them, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Make sure you're subscribed to YouTube Premium. </strong>While I wouldn't recommend starting a whole subscription just to try out a new feature, if you're not subscribed you won't be able to see these. You can check your subscription status in the YouTube mobile app by tapping your profile icon and heading to Settings &gt; Purchases and memberships.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you're in the U.S. </strong>I <em>especially</em> don't recommend emigrating to another country to try out an experimental AI feature. But on the off chance that your account's location is set to somewhere outside the U.S. (like if you're <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-paid-vpns" target="_blank"><u>using a VPN by default</u></a>), make sure YouTube thinks you're in the U.S.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enroll in the carousel experimental feature. </strong>You might have already signed up to try experimental features, but this one needs to be turned on directly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Head here</u></a> or in the YouTube app head to <strong>Settings &gt; Try experimental new features</strong>. Then, enable "AI-powered search results carousel."</p></li><li><p><strong>Try some searches related to shopping or places. </strong>Most searches will still provide the typical results, but Google suggests topics related to shopping (such as "noise cancelling headphones") or place (such as "best beaches in Hawaii").</p></li></ul><p>Even if you follow all of these steps, however, you still might not see the new feature. I've been a YouTube Premium subscriber since <a href="https://lifehacker.com/google-sucks-at-naming-stuff-1738016114" target="_blank"><u>it was called YouTube Red</u></a>, enabled this experiment, and tried the example searches (plus many more) and never saw the carousel once. YouTube says the feature is only available to a "randomly selected number of Premium members" so it seems there's no guarantee you'll get to try it out even if you opt in.</p><p>If you <em>don't </em>want this feature, the good news is that you don't have to do anything for now. This experimental trial will last until July 30. While that doesn't necessarily mean that it will roll out more widely after that, it's a safe bet that you've at least got another month before it becomes something you have to opt out of.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That means there are 13 American cities left with in-person showrooms:</p><ul><li><p>California: Newport Beach and Palo Alto</p></li><li><p>Nevada: Las Vegas</p></li><li><p>New York City</p></li><li><p>North Carolina: Raleigh</p></li><li><p>Oregon: Portland</p></li><li><p>Tennessee: Nashville</p></li><li><p>Texas: Dallas, Plano, Southlake, and Houston</p></li><li><p>Utah: Murray</p></li><li><p>Virginia: Tysons Corner</p></li></ul><p>For more details (or to see the surprisingly robust amount of stores in other countries, like Austria and Germany), check <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/showrooms" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Peloton's official site</a>. </p><h2 id="other-buying-options">Other buying options</h2><p>You have other options if you're in the market for Peloton equipment. First, of course, is ordering online directly <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Ge6w?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=through%20Peloton%27s%20website&amp;short_url=z3Ge6w&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">through Peloton's website</a>. You'll spend no less than $1,400, but you'll get free delivery and installation, plus assurance that you have a new, high-quality piece of equipment backed by the company's one-year warranty. </p><p>As of last month, the company is also operating <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-launches-resale-platform" target="_blank">a resale site called Repowered</a>. Right now, you can only list your old machines and accessories, but once there's enough inventory, you'll be able to buy there, too. Unlike buying on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, you're still technically purchasing your equipment through Peloton, meaning you'll have a safer, more reliable experience. If you sell on Repowered, you not only get money for the device you're getting rid of, but you get a discount on your next new Peloton purchase, too. Here's what you get off from each product if you make a Repowered sale:</p><ul><li><p>Bike+: $400 off</p></li><li><p>Tread: $200 off</p></li><li><p>Tread+: $600 off</p></li><li><p>Row: $200 off</p></li></ul><p>You can also try <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/why-you-should-buy-used-peloton" target="_blank">other resale platforms</a>, like TradeMyStuff, which has its own guarantees, offers delivery and installation, and will even pay the $95 fee associated with activating used equipment on your behalf. </p><p>Finally, Amazon is always an option, too. The company <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03L2m?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=sells%20directly&amp;short_url=a03L2m&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">sells directly</a> through a verified storefront on the e-commerce giant, so the prices you'll find on Amazon are the same as what you'll get on Peloton's own site. You can opt for professional installation in the room of your choice. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Garmin has <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-8-series/f/announcements/415330/beta-version-17-11--check-for-updates-only" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">just announced</a> an absolutely massive feature update via public beta for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ0Ad?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Fenix%208&amp;short_url=aNJ0Ad&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Fenix 8</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3YgE?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Enduro%203&amp;short_url=9l3YgE&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Enduro 3</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgGxX?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Fenix%20E&amp;short_url=aDgGxX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Fenix E</a> watches. This adds in all of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-is-launching-the-forerunner-570-and-970-watches" target="_blank">newly announced</a> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdbv12?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Forerunner%20970&amp;short_url=Qdbv12&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Forerunner 970</a> running features, the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbYgy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Venu%20X1&amp;short_url=9gbYgy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Venu X1</a> features, plus a few entirely new to Garmin features as well. This beta release (version 17.11)  pulls together features that were previously exclusive to specific device lines and makes them available across their flagship outdoor watch series. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Fenix E&mdash;which has struggled to find its market position&mdash;is receiving the same treatment as the more expensive Fenix 8 and Enduro 3. Let's take a look at what new features you can start using, depending on your Garmin device of choice.</p><h2 id="features-brand-new-to-garmin-devices">Features brand new to Garmin devices</h2><p>The beta update introduces 28 new features, ranging from entirely new applications to advanced training metrics. Several features make their debut across the entire Garmin ecosystem:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Calculator app</strong>: A full-featured calculator with tip calculation and bill-splitting functionality</p></li><li><p><strong>Ability to access apps list by swiping left on watch face</strong>: A new navigation method for quicker app access</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom focus modes</strong>: Long-awaited expansion of the focus modes feature first introduced last summer</p></li><li><p><strong>Editing for all previous sets in strength training</strong>: Enhanced strength training workflow capabilities</p></li><li><p><strong>Japanese kana keyboard</strong>: Expanding language support for international users</p></li><li><p><strong>Music options to music controls page</strong>: Enhanced music playback controls</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for track/road display transitions</strong>: Improved display optimization for different running surfaces</p></li><li><p><strong>Track run option for daily suggested workouts</strong>: Integration of track-specific training into automated workout suggestions</p></li></ul><h2 id="new-features-from-forerunner-570970">New features from Forerunner 570/970</h2><p>Some of the advanced running capabilities that made the Forerunner 970 a standout device are now available on the Fenix outdoor watch series:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Running economy support</strong>: Advanced metabolic efficiency tracking</p></li><li><p><strong>Running tolerance support</strong>: Recovery and training load management</p></li><li><p><strong>Step speed loss support</strong>: Biomechanical analysis for running efficiency</p></li><li><p><strong>Evening report support</strong>: Comprehensive end-of-day health and training summaries</p></li><li><p><strong>Expanded morning report support</strong>: Enhanced daily readiness insights</p></li><li><p><strong>Garmin alerts to notification center</strong>: Centralized alert management</p></li><li><p><strong>Multisport workout support</strong>: Structured training across multiple disciplines</p></li><li><p><strong>Running power to lactate threshold page</strong>: Power-based threshold analysis</p></li><li><p><strong>Provisional finish point support</strong>: Race strategy and pacing tools</p></li><li><p><strong>Triathlon adaptive training plan support</strong>: AI-driven triathlon training periodization</p></li><li><p><strong>Triathlon race events support</strong>: Comprehensive race day features for triathletes</p></li></ul><h2 id="features-from-other-garmin-devices">Features from other Garmin devices</h2><p>The update also brings capabilities from other recent Garmin releases:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Smart wake alarm</strong> (from <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/garmins-new-vivoactive-6-smart-alarm-and-walking-workouts" target="_blank">Vivoactive 6</a>): Intelligent wake timing based on sleep cycles</p></li><li><p><strong>Additional keyboard layouts and emoji support</strong>: Enhanced text input capabilities for Android users</p></li></ul><h2 id="sport-specific-enhancements">Sport-specific enhancements</h2><p>If you golf or sail, check these out:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Golf range finder settings menu</strong>: Improved golf functionality</p></li><li><p><strong>Race timer data field for sail race activity</strong>: Enhanced sailing competition features</p></li><li><p><strong>Tack assist data page in sailing activities</strong>: Advanced sailing navigation aids</p></li></ul><h2 id="what-this-means-for-garmin-users">What this means for Garmin users</h2><p>Notably, about the only missing feature from recent Garmin releases is the "<strong>Auto lap"</strong> for races with timing gates (where the watch will adjust your mileage as you pass the gate), which came to the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/garmin-is-launching-the-forerunner-570-and-970-watches" target="_blank">Forerunner 570/970</a> and also the Venu X1. For current Fenix 8, Enduro 3, and Fenix E owners, this update is pretty major. Whether you're a triathlete, elite runner, or just wanted a damn calculator, this update has something for you. The beta is available now for users enrolled in <a href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=bVo5U5BV292BSr2gkZhY2A" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Garmin's public beta program</a>, with a stable release expected in the coming weeks. As Garmin continues to refine and expand these capabilities, we can expect additional features and improvements to roll out throughout the remainder of 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Up until last summer, I had this <a href="https://zdcs.link/DZ2LX?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Lasko%20oscillating%20tower%20fan&amp;short_url=DZ2LX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Lasko oscillating tower fan </a>($69.99 after coupon), and it lasted me a commendable seven years. It would have lasted longer if I hadn't knocked it over so often and neglected to clean it as well as I should have (so <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-clean-portable-fan" target="_blank">please clean your fans</a>), but even when the vents were full of dust, this bad boy blasted cool air far and wide. At 42 inches tall, it's a little cumbersome, so only pick it up if you have the space for it and the willingness to clean a bunch of tiny slats on the back. It's no-frills (save for a convenient remote control that enables you to change the speed and toggle on the oscillation from across the room), but it does mean business. </p><p>I replaced that Lasko with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/kp646?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Antarctic%20Star%20tower%20fan&amp;short_url=kp646&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Antarctic Star tower fan</a> ($64.99) and am personally very happy with it. Like other models here, it has a remote control, oscillates, and has three different speeds. It was easy to set up and has a cute light pink color. If aesthetics are important to you but you still want something powerful, this has my full endorsement. It's running next to me right now and is still as powerful and relatively quiet as it was last year. It's forceful enough that I keep it across the room from me when <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-review" target="_blank">I work out on my Peloton</a> and it manages to give me the perfect breeze from several feet away.  </p><p>If you want something that has a wide radius, consider a <a href="https://zdcs.link/q7WrG?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Levoit%20tower%20fan&amp;short_url=q7WrG&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Levoit tower fan</a> ($74.99), which can cool up to 25 feet away. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@loopyslimeofficial/video/7344098899189042475" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Reviewers have put the claim to the test</a>, demonstrating that it actually <em>does </em>reach 25 feet, which is great news for anyone with a large room that needs some air circulation. Since this one is on the spendier side of our budget allowance, I recommend waiting to buy it if you can. Per price-tracking tool CamelCamelCamel, this model has gone on sale for as low as $59.49. Granted, the price will probably stay higher in the summer, when consumers want fans most, but don't forget that <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank">Prime Day and all the shopping holiday's associated deals</a> are on the way.</p><p>On the smaller side, I picked up this <a href="https://zdcs.link/XBkmY?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Conbola%20desk%20fan&amp;short_url=XBkmY&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Conbola desk fan</a> ($26.57) two years ago and can't believe how much I still like it. I use a small fan on my nightstand to generate white noise at night and while this is much smaller and sleeker than the relative behemoth I had before, it's just as powerful and just noisy enough for bedtime. What drew me to it was its pink color, of course, but what made me love it was its features: It only needs a small USB cord to function and when plugged in, it's also charging, so it can be moved around and doesn't need to be tethered to an outlet at all times. A few months ago, I very nearly broke this fan while <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/dont-use-viral-tiktok-fan-cleaning-method" target="_blank">testing out a cleaning hack</a>. I was devastated; it's such a perfect little object that does exactly what I need it to do. Fortunately, it was safe in the end (a testament to its resilience, no doubt!). If you want something that holds up under pressure and looks good doing it for a mere $26, you know what to do.</p><p>Conbola, a brand to which I have become strangely loyal after the great success of my little pink fan, also makes a <a href="https://zdcs.link/pGoxl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=bladeless%20desk%20option&amp;short_url=pGoxl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">bladeless desk option</a> ($39.99) for those who want that Dyson look without the Dyson price (more on that in a moment). You get three speed options, touch controls, and the ability to charge it and move it around. The nice thing about bladeless fans is how easy they are to clean: Wipe out the inside and use a dust cloth on the vents without ever having to take it apart. </p><h2 id="pricier-fan-options">Pricier fan options</h2><p>There are a lot of things in life you can get by with cheaping out on, but whether you want to gamble with the heat is really up to you. Personally, I am a penny pincher and I adore the cheap, pink fans I detailed above, but I also know that heat is dangerous to not only your physical health, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/effects-of-heat-waves-on-humans-mental-health" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">but your mental health</a>, too. Depending on where you live and what you're willing to shell out, this might be the summer you invest in a big, fancy fan. </p><div class="shadow-b-2 mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-[#F0F0F0] px-6 py-2 shadow-lg md:px-12" role="region" aria-label="Products List" x-data="{ showMore: false }">

Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</p><p>If you have big DIY plans this summer, it can be a challenge to build out your toolkit and still have money left over for the actual project. It's here that season sales can truly help&mdash;like Home Depot's "Super Savings Sale," pegged to the Fourth of July. I've checked out the deals on offer to highlight my picks for the best cordless drills, saws, and more that you can grab at a discount right now.</p><h2 id="deals-on-cordless-tool-bundles">Deals on cordless tool bundles</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re new to DIY or haven't upgraded your tools in a decade or so, picking up a bundle of cordless tools and batteries is a good way to start building out your kit.

<p>The idea behind Infinidesk is that you'll make different desktops for different projects, allowing you to use your desktop as a workspace for each of them. This isn't at all like your Mac's native Mission Control&mdash;it doesn't affect the windows you have open. The focus, instead, is simply on the icons visible on your desktop. You can create as many different desktops as you need to. When you create a new desktop, all of your current icons will disappear, allowing you to add new ones. When you switch between desktops, all of your icons will disappear and reappear accordingly. </p><p>It's a simple concept, and it won't be useful for everyone&mdash;only some of us even still use our desktops to store files at this point, and you might already have your own system for keeping things organized. But if your desktop is spiraling out of control, Infinidesk might help you keep things tidy without making the desktop useless in the process&mdash;especially if you have one computer for both work and personal use.</p><p>Infinidesk offers a free version, with a catch: you can only switch desktops 50 times. That should be enough for you to get a feel for whether this application is useful for you, though. The full version costs $12.99, as a one-time payment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>As a shopping writer prepping for Prime Day, I use Camelcamelcamel, Honey,
                SlickDeals, and others to help me determine whether online deals are, well, the real

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever felt like you were duped by overpaying for something that was advertised as a &ldquo;great deal,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re in the right place. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in frenzied online shopping holidays like the upcoming <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank">Prime Day sale</a>, with competition from <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-sale-2025" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-targets-circle-week-sale" target="_blank">Target</a>, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/walmart-deals-sale-is-walmarts-answer-to-prime-day" target="_blank">Walmart</a>&mdash;<strong> </strong>especially when these retailers sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/that-amazon-deal-might-actually-be-a-hidden-price-hike-1849649849" target="_blank">sneak price hikes before major &ldquo;sales&rdquo;</a> or deceive shoppers with <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-amazon-tricks-you-into-spending-more-on-pr-1849158042" target="_blank">tricks to spend more than you intended to</a>. </p><p>Figuring out the best time to buy something requires constant watch over ever-fluctuating online prices <em>and</em> some knowledge of how prices have changed in the past. As a shopping and deals writer, that is what I do for a living, and I know how time-consuming it can be. Luckily, you don&rsquo;t have to figure it all out yourself: Here are the best websites and extensions I've been using for years to check price history and track prices so that you can be sure you&rsquo;re getting the best deal possible.</p><h2 id="the-best-amazon-price-tracker-camelcamelcamel">The best Amazon price tracker: Camelcamelcamel</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">CamelCamelCamel</a> is among the best ways to track prices on Amazon products.

CamelCamelCamel shows you how the price of the item has gone up or down over time, how prices have changed through Amazon directly, and the fluctuations from third-party Amazon sellers who list new and used items.</p><p>If you sign up for a free account, you can set up alerts so the site can notify you by email when the price of an item drops below a certain amount, if you can get it used for a given price, or if it&rsquo;s at an all-time low and now is a good time to buy. You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike. </p><h2 id="the-best-price-tracker-for-most-online-retailers-and-to-compare-prices-honey">The best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You've probably already heard of the "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/honey-influencer-scam-explained" target="_blank">Honey influencer scam</a>" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services. </p><p>The bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/explore" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Honey's price-tracking tool</a> can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honey-automatic-coupons-r/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Honey browser extension</a> compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you&rsquo;re willing to wait for a deal. Here is <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/everything-you-should-do-now-if-you-shop-on-black-frida-1850945998#:~:text=Use%20the%20tools%20available%20to%20you" target="_blank">what creating a Droplist can do for you</a>:</p><blockquote><p>First, it&rsquo;ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it&rsquo;ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.&#65279;</p></blockquote><p>As long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. You can still use their tool to your advantage without giving them any of the affiliate revenue. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).</p><h2 id="the-best-tool-to-compare-prices-capital-one-shopping">The best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Of course, it&rsquo;s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it&rsquo;ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all&mdash;and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.</p><p>When you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.</p><h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h2><h3>Keepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The service doesn&rsquo;t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup&mdash;it only shows a &ldquo;deal history&rdquo; under the &ldquo;price intelligence&rdquo; section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Now there's faster way to search your Google photos using Gemini AI.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google&rsquo;s AI-powered Ask Photos feature <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-soon-use-gemini-to-search-google-photos" target="_blank">was announced last year</a>, but failed to make a splash when it started rolling out to the public. It replaced the regular photo search feature with a Gemini AI search that, often, took too much time when you just wanted to find photos of your pets, or your car. This was such an issue that my colleagues starting using a workaround that let them <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/use-this-shortcut-to-remove-ai-from-google-photos-search" target="_blank">skip Ask Photos entirely</a>, shifting back to the classic search option instead.</p><p>Google seems to have noticed, because early this month, the company paused the rollout of the feature altogether. According to a <a href="https://x.com/jamieasp/status/1929895255844745284" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Google Product Manager</a>, the feature wasn't "where it needs to be, in terms of latency, quality and ux." Now, Google is resuming that rollout again, fixing what was perhaps the biggest issue with Ask Photos.</p><h2 id="ask-photos-now-works-with-simple-search-terms-too">Ask Photos now works with simple search terms, too</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Ask Photos is <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/updates-ask-photos-search/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Google&rsquo;s upgraded search feature</a> for Google Photos that combines Gemini AI and regular photo search. So, you can ask it detailed and complex questions like, "find all the photos from 2012 when I had short hair," or "find all the photos of my old van parked at the beach." In theory, it would understand what you&rsquo;re saying (thanks to Gemini AI), and then go about your photo library finding what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>The problem with Ask Photos was its latency, especially when it came to single word searches, like &ldquo;cats,&rdquo; &ldquo;nature,&rdquo; &ldquo;boat,&rdquo; and so on. Google says that it's fixed this issue, and when you use a short search phrase in Ask Photos, you&rsquo;ll see search results instantly, like you do in classic search.</p><p>Google says that it's made more complex searches faster, too. So when you ask for photos from a particular vacation, or photos with both your kids on the beach, Google will show you the results more quickly. Supposedly, you won&rsquo;t have to wait forever for Gemini AI to think before you start seeing your photos.</p><h2 id="how-to-try-the-new-ask-photos-update">How to try the new Ask Photos update</h2><p>Google says that the Ask Photos update will start to roll out to a wider set of users now. But it&rsquo;s still limited to the US. <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>According to Google</u></a>, you will need to be 18 or older, be based in the United States, and have your Google Account language set to English (United States) for this feature to work. Plus, you&rsquo;ll also need to have <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128838?sjid=10885491250132688314-NC" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>the Face Groups feature</u></a> enabled.</p><p>Once you meet all these requirements, it&rsquo;s going to be a waiting game fro you to get the update, as Google is slowly expanding the availability of the Ask Photos feature. Until then, you can continue to use the classic search method.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Services like Sniffspot and Rome turn your open spaces into
                revenue-generating private dog parks.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans loves their dogs&mdash;<a href="https://www.avma.org/news/pet-population-continues-increase-while-pet-spending-declines" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">all 90 million of them</a>. And dog owners know there&rsquo;s nothing better than letting your dog off their leash to run around free. For a lot of folks who don&rsquo;t have a lot of outdoor space, or who live in homes with communal spaces where letting your dog off the leash isn&rsquo;t allowed, that means bringing their pet to a dog park.</p><p>But not all areas have conveniently located dog parks, and visiting those parks comes with some <a href="https://lifehacker.com/are-dog-parks-safe-for-dogs-1850809221" target="_blank">inherent risks</a>&mdash;from aggressive dogs and communicable canine diseases, among others. If you own a private outdoor space, that&rsquo;s an opportunity for you: You can make some pretty decent money renting it out as a private dog park using apps like <a href="https://www.sniffspot.com/host" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Sniffspot</a> and <a href="https://www.theromeapp.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Rome</a>.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-your-yard-as-a-private-dog-park">How to set up your yard as a private dog park</h2><p>Both apps work similarly: You set up a listing for your fenced outdoor space (with a detailed description of its size; doggie amenities like trees, pools, or agility runs; and human amenities like wifi, parking, and seating). People looking for a place to let their dogs run free browse listings, find yours, and book it, typically by the hour. Renters can essentially consider these spaces as private dog parks, so they won&rsquo;t have to worry about strange dogs, negligent owners, or unexpected problems.</p><p>Sniffspot requires that folks seeking to rent a dog park have a "Sniffpass" subscription, which costs $16 to $96 per month, depending on the level of membership chosen (different levels come with different &ldquo;booking credits&rdquo; and discounts). Rome users don&rsquo;t have to subscribe to book a space.</p><p>Both Sniffspot and Rome also offer included insurance to protect hosts against damage or liability issues&mdash;Sniffspot <a href="https://help.sniffspot.com/article/200-1m-host-protection-insurance" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">covers</a> up to $2 million in liability insurance and up to $5,000 for property damage. <a href="https://www.theromeapp.com/rome-cover" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Rome Cover</a> offers up to $500,000 of liability protection, as well as legal defense and medical funding.</p><h2 id="how-much-you-can-make-renting-out-your-yard-as-a-dog-park">How much you can make renting out your yard as a dog park</h2><p>With both Sniffspot and Rome, you get to choose how much to charge, but most hosts charge between $5 and $20 per hour, depending on the size of the space and the amenities it offers. Sniffspot <a href="https://help.sniffspot.com/article/32-how-much-does-sniffspot-charge" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">takes about 25%</a> off the top as a fee for using their platform, while Rome takes 15%. Rome pays its hosts weekly, while Sniffspot pays out monthly. </p><p>You can make some real money this way&mdash;one woman in North Carolina reporting earning an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/backyard-side-hustle-renting-out-land-as-private-dog-park-sniffspot.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">average of $7,100 per month</a> in the first half of 2024. Your earning potential will vary, of course, depending on demand as well as what you can offer the dogs in your area.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started-renting-out-your-yard-for-dogs">How to get started renting out your yard for dogs</h2><p>If making some extra money by letting adorable dogs run around your backyard sounds terrific, there are some basic best practices you should follow to ensure your space stands out:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Provide lots of photos.</strong> Both apps recommend you post a lot of photos with your listing, so dog owners can see where their doggos will be playing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consider accessibility issues.</strong> Folks have to be able to access the area without passing through a private residence. Many people prefer being able to access the space without having to interact with the owner at all, so being able to offer truly private access is a plus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure your space is safe.</strong> Both Rome and Sniffspot require that your space be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/10-cheap-ways-to-fence-in-your-yard-1849354922" target="_blank">fenced-in</a> and secure, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to consider how effective your fence is. If it&rsquo;s old or low, replacing or repairing it is a good idea. Also make sure there are no dangerous objects (like poisonous plants or rusting old gardening tools), pesticides, or other hazards that could endanger visiting pups.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add some amenities.</strong> Spaces range from small backyards to expansive properties of several acres, but whether you&rsquo;re offering a postage stamp or a farm you should consider the amenities you can add to enhance the value of your listing. Some properties offer hiking trails, dog hammocks, or pools for the dogs, and some consider their human guests as well, providing lounge chairs, fire pits&mdash;even barbecues. If you can offer the humans a restroom of some kind, that&rsquo;s a big bonus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Provide for owners' basic needs.</strong> The terms of both apps require guests to clean up after their dogs and leave the property as they found it, so providing poop bags, trash receptacles, and hand sanitizer is a plus.</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most underrated <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/favorite-new-features-and-changes-in-the-second-ios-26-beta" target="_blank">new features in iOS 26</a> is trying out new AirPods features before they're released to everyone else. Yes, Apple's newest operating system now lets you download and install beta firmware updates to your AirPods. Here's everything you need to know to try this out yourself, and a quick list of the features you can try right away.</p><h2 id="dont-update-your-airpods-recklessly">Don't update your AirPods recklessly</h2><p>First, if you value reliability over everything else, I'd recommend against installing beta firmware on your AirPods. This is because betas are not as polished as release versions, and may come with bugs. For your AirPods, that could mean frequent disconnection, audio cutting out, pairing issues, degraded mic quality, or one of many other potential pitfalls. This isn't to say that you'll always face issues when using betas, but there's always a risk of encountering problems. While it's possible to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-uninstall-the-ios-26-beta" target="_blank">return to a stable version of iOS</a> or macOS even after installing a beta version, you can't do so with AirPods. It's important to understand the risks before you opt to try these beta features out.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-try-out-beta-airpods-firmware">What you need to try out beta AirPods firmware</h2><p>To try out beta firmware on your AirPods, you'll first need to have an iPhone/iPad running iOS 26/iPadOS 26, or eventually, a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-macos-26-tahoe-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">Mac running macOS 26</a>. The following AirPods models support beta firmware:</p><ul><li><p>AirPods 4</p></li><li><p>AirPods 4 (with active noise cancellation)</p></li><li><p>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)</p></li><li><p>AirPods Pro 2 (Lightning)</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-install-airpods-beta-firmware">How to install AirPods beta firmware</h2><p>With the preamble aside, the actual installation process for AirPods beta firmware is fairly straightforward. On your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">iPhone running iOS 26</a>, connect your AirPods and go to <strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong>. Tap the <strong>i</strong> button next to your AirPods' name, scroll down, and tap <strong>AirPods Beta Updates</strong>. On the next page, enable the toggle that shows up.&nbsp;These instructions also work for devices running iPadOS 26.</p><p>Mac users will have to wait a little bit before they can install beta firmware to their AirPods, but Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/#airpods-beta" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">says</a> it's coming soon. Once the feature is live, you'll need to go to <strong>System Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong> on your Mac and tap the <strong>i</strong> button next to your AirPods' name. Select <strong>AirPods Beta Updates</strong> and enable them.</p><h2 id="the-new-ios-26-features-you-can-try-on-your-airpods-now">The new iOS 26 features you can try on your AirPods now</h2><p>The beta update comes with a number of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-announced-two-new-airpods-features-no-one-saw-coming-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">new Airpods features</a>, so there's no shortage of things to try. Here are the big ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Camera remote</strong>: You can press the stem of your AirPods to take a photo with your iPhone, or to start/stop a video recording.</p></li><li><p><strong>Better call quality</strong>: Apple's promising improved audio quality on phone calls, FaceTime calls, and for other calling apps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep audio on AirPods</strong>: When your iPhone connects to other Bluetooth devices, you'll be able to choose to keep playing audio via your AirPods.</p></li><li><p><strong>'Studio-quality' recording</strong>: Apple says your AirPods' mic will be able to record higher quality audio in iOS 26.</p></li><li><p><strong>Auto-pause at bedtime</strong>: When you wear your AirPods to bed, they'll be able to pause audio automatically as you fall asleep.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic switching with CarPlay</strong>: You'll notice that your iPhone's audio automatically switches to CarPlay as you enter your car.&nbsp;</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>How to Broil in Your Oven (Without Ruining Your Food)</title>

            <description>Broiling is a handy skill for your cooking repertoire, but a small misstep
                can burn or dry out your food.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up, I loved cooking but I fully avoided the broiler. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but maybe because my mom never used it or perhaps I just wasn't sure what it was. The entire time, I was wondering how to get a crispy, browned surface on my mac and cheese and toast my breadcrumb-topped casseroles.<em> How did chefs do it?</em> </p><p>It turns out, the broiler is exactly the handy tool you need to finish off dishes to crispy, melty, browned perfection, and it&rsquo;s likely been in your kitchen this entire time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="check-to-see-where-your-broiler-lives">Check to see where your broiler lives</h2><p>The first time I tried to broil, I was an adult and in my first apartment. I had seen enough Food Network to know I was capable of doing it. Emboldened, I set up my casserole in the oven and bravely clicked &ldquo;broil.&rdquo; I eagerly awaited crispy edges and bubbly cheese, but nothing happened. The oven actually didn&rsquo;t feel very hot at all. The only thing that I got was a harsh smell.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried a few more times after that and the same thing happened. The oven was working&mdash;I could hear it&mdash;but no bubbles and only a nasty smell. Maybe I had been right about broiling the whole time. It's not so great. I gave up. A year later I was moving out and I had to pack up my kitchen pans. I opened the lower storage drawer of the oven and observed a collection of warped, discolored pans. That particular oven had a <em>lower drawer broiler</em> and I was storing pans in there.</p><p>The broiler might be inside the main oven cavity, where just the top heating element will fire up. It could be in a lower drawer, in which case the oven's lower heating element will activate but the food goes underneath. (Do not store pots and pans in this area if that&rsquo;s the case.) Some ovens might have a separate mini oven where you can put food for broiling. I always think of the old Rachel Ray show where her broiler was a hinged trap door she would throw toast in.&nbsp;Before you click any buttons, find out where your broiler lives.</p><h2 id="what-is-broiling">What is broiling?</h2><p>The broiler function in your oven activates a single, upper (in relationship to the food) heating element that gets turned up to a scorching hot temperature, usually around 500&deg;F. Your job is to put the food item right underneath, or at least close. It&rsquo;s meant to quickly heat only the top of the food, so the rest of the dish or item needs to be cooked through beforehand. It&rsquo;s hot and it&rsquo;s <em>fast</em>. And if it&rsquo;s not happening fast (like within two to five minutes) then you might need to locate your broiler or the positioning is off. </p><h2 id="when-you-should-consider-broiling">When you should consider broiling</h2><p>Broiling only heats from the top, so you&rsquo;ll use your broiler for crisping any surface that&rsquo;s facing upward. Broiling is excellent for casseroles that you want to crisp on top. It&rsquo;s also great for finishing off thick steaks to get some color, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-grill-like-a-pro-using-your-ovens-broiler-1848549201" target="_blank">oven grilling</a>, fish, or even making <a href="https://lifehacker.com/make-perfect-smores-using-the-broiler-1836218606" target="_blank">broiler s'mores</a>. It uses very high heat, so you probably wouldn&rsquo;t use the broiler for anything you&rsquo;ve cooked in a delicate fashion, like custard. However, if you topped said custard with sugar and you want to broil the top for cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, this could be the perfect usage. Just keep a <em>very</em> close eye on the caramelizing sugar, and how close you put the custard to the heating element, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/txcdr9/attempts_1_and_2_at_cr%C3%A8me_br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e_using_a_broiler/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>this Reddit user</u></a> discovered.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-use-the-broiler">How to use the broiler</h2><p>Activating the broiler is simple. Your oven likely has a single button or switch that says &ldquo;broil.&rdquo; It has a set temperature so you don&rsquo;t need to do anything besides press that button and it&rsquo;ll automatically begin. My oven has a hi-lo option, so I can press it twice for a lower temperature broil. You may need to press the start button, depending on your oven.&nbsp;</p><p>Where you place the food under the broiler is a slightly more nuanced decision. Place it too close and you can burn the food; too far away and the browning will take much longer and you risk overcooking the dish through to the center. When I was first trying out the broiler, the latter was my problem. I ended up overcooking and drying out my mac and cheese because I was trying to broil the top, but it was too far away.&nbsp;</p><p>I recommend placing the surface of the item about five inches from the broiler element. Then you can assess how it&rsquo;s going. Browning should occur within three minutes. It is seriously fast. So if you&rsquo;re not pleased with how it&rsquo;s going, you may want to move the oven rack up one notch to get the item closer. You can also slide an overturned baking pan under the dish to lift it up an inch.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="best-practices-for-broiling">Best practices for broiling</h2><p>Be aware of the dish you're using under the broiler. Coated or non-stick cookware can be damaged, so be sure to use casserole dishes that can stand up to broiling (ceramic, tempered glass, or borosilicate), cast iron skillets, or stainless steel frying pans that are oven-safe.</p><p>Make sure you set a timer for broiling. Three to five minutes is usually sufficient, and you&rsquo;d be surprised how easy it is to forget about it for 10 minutes. The aroma of scorched food is loved by none. With that in mind, you&rsquo;re ready to broil.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Kitchens are a pressure cooker (pun more or less intended), whether you're trying to get your high-end restaurant off the ground in order to sustain some kind of family legacy or just trying to keep the pasta from boiling over in your own home. Cooking is challenging, even when the only person to say "yes, chef" to is you. </p><p><em>The Bear</em>'s 2022 debut kicked off a new interest in a specific sub-genre of shows dealing with the stresses and joys of food and the restaurant business. These shows approach those topics from different angles and different tones&mdash;some of them will keep your stressed-out <em>Bear</em>-buzz going, while others will serve to bring the heat down.</p><h2 id="julia-2022-2023-two-seasons"><em>Julia</em> (2022 &ndash; 2023, two seasons)</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video">

<p>It&rsquo;s a good moment to revisit Julia Child. At a critical period in American culture, she reinvented herself multiple times, first by learning to cook when she was already nearly 40, parlaying her talent into a bestselling cookbook; and then when she moved into television, becoming an unexpected celebrity in the process. Though they&rsquo;re not related, strictly speaking, the 2009 movie <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em> focused on the lead-up to Child&rsquo;s fame, while this series spotlights the chef (Sarah Lancashire, serving up an absolutely impeccable performance) during her early days in the spotlight as she experienced upheavals to her own life and the broader cultural shifts ongoing at the time. The show makes clear just how transformative Child was for our television and cultural landscape, even if her kitchen wasn't quite the pressure-cooker we see in something like <em>The Bear</em>. <strong>You can stream <em>Julia</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEeL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=HBO%20Max&amp;short_url=92xEeL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">HBO Max</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Taking on restaurant culture from another side (and another city), <em>Sweetbitter</em> is based on the novel of the same name from Stephanie Danler, who based it on her experiences as an NYC waitress (she also created the series and wrote the pilot). <em>Yellowjackets</em>' Ella Purnell plays Tess, 21 at the series' opening, as she arrives in the city and gets a job at a prestigious restaurant. As we (and she) quickly learn, there's at least as much drama (including drugs, booze, and sex) on the service side of the industry as there is in the kitchen. <strong>You can stream <em>Sweetbitter</em> on Starz or rent it from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwYXy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video.&amp;short_url=QqwYXy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video.</a></strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>This wildly popular K-drama feels, in many ways, like an exemplar of the form, at least to American audiences who might have limited exposure to Korean TV beyond <em>Squid Game</em>. It's got action and family drama, as well as a compelling love triangle, but also deals with themes of class and injustice. Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) has just been released from prison after a wrongful three-year sentence, with only one goal in mind: to turn a pub into the biggest and best restaurant chain in South Korea (which will also serve as his own brand of revenge on those who saw him imprisoned). Itaewon is one of Seoul's most diverse neighborhoods, and Sae-ro-yi's ambitious plan draws a found family of misfits who want to help to turn the bar into something truly impressive. <strong>You can stream<em> Itaewon Class </em>on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81193309" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>.</strong> </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Though a bit lesser known stateside, the British sitcom <em>Chef!</em> remains a fan favorite for its smart scripts, impressive production values, and (frequently) vicious sense of humor. Lenny Henry plays the perfectionist, imperious Gareth Blackstock, one of English comedy&rsquo;s top-tier arseholes, the type of all-but-irredeemable character who could <em>never</em> be a lead in an American sitcom. There are family elements here, but the series also deals with the nitty gritty of preparing fine meals&mdash;not just the cooking (though there&rsquo;s plenty of that) but the logistics and economics of food obsession. <strong>You can stream <em>Chef!</em> on <a href="https://tubitv.com/series/300000677/chef" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Tubi</a></strong><strong> and Britbox.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Anthony Bourdain's photo hangs on the wall in Carmy's kitchen, and it's not hard to see the link: Bourdain's career blended a passion for food with a reluctance to suffer fools. For Bourdain, food wasn't a means to an end; it was a means to explore culture and community&mdash;and <em>Parts Unknown</em> fulfills that brief. While the series finds the chef traveling all over the world, season seven brings him to Chicago and sees him sit down for a fried steak sandwich at local landmark Ricobene's. <strong>You can stream <em>Parts Unknown</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62Eo2?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=HBO%20Max&amp;short_url=z62Eo2&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">HBO Max</a></strong><strong>, Discovery+, and the Roku Channel or buy episodes from <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03Lnw?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Prime%20Video&amp;short_url=a03Lnw&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Prime Video</a></strong><strong>.</strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A big step away from the high-intensity drama of Carmy's kitchen, <em>From Scratch</em> takes us to Florence, Italy following art student Amy (Zoe Salda&ntilde;a). There, she meets and falls in love with Sicilian chef Lino (Eugenio Mastrandrea). It's sweet and sentimental, unashamedly so, but the performances rescue it from ever feeling cloying. It's based, roughly, on the memoir from Tembi Locke (who co-created the show), and draws us into the world of high-end Italian cuisine just as Amy is being drawn into Chef Lino's world. <strong>You can stream <em>From Scratch</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81104486" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>I'm mostly bringing up <em>Shameless</em> for the Jeremy Allen White of it all&mdash;he plays Lip, the second child of Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy) and someone forced into a caregiver role in his family (alongside older sister Fiona) despite his fiery temper and struggles with substance abuse. Both comedy/dramas involve complicated, largely dysfunctional Chicago-area families that, nevertheless, find ways to stick together (for better and worse). In both shows, White's characters become the tempestuous, reluctant glue that holds everything together. <strong>You can stream <em>Shameless</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70184207" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Netflix</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>A half-hour comedy-drama, but with an emphasis on the comedy, <em>Gentefied</em> follows three Mexican-American cousins who have built lives in Los Angeles, only to be faced with a new challenge: the looming gentrification of the neighborhood they helped to build with their family's taco shop. Much as <em>The Bear</em> captures a sense of Chicago's specific food culture, <em>Gentefied</em> has a baked-in sense of place and culture. This bilingual series has a lot of heart, and, the second season is even better than the first. <strong>You can stream <em>Gentefied</em> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80198208" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Netflix.</u></a></strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>Reality competition <em>Next Level Chef</em>, in which Gordon Ramsay is joined by judges Nyesha Arrington and Richard Blais, simulates the high-pressure atmosphere of a professional kitchen with a little less swearing than you might get elsewhere, but just as many people shouting "yes, chef!" The judges here also serve as mentors to cooking hopefuls who are assigned to one of three kitchens: one fully decked-out, one extremely basic, and a third that's more or less in the middle. It's a bit more stressful than <em>Bake-Off</em>, but certainly less dramatic than <em>The Bear </em>(even given the real-life stakes for the contestants), so it might be a good way to wind down from your recent <em>Bear</em> binge. <strong>You can stream <em>Next Level Chef</em> on <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OkML?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Hulu&amp;short_url=z7OkML&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Hulu</a></strong><strong>. </strong></p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

It&rsquo;s also down to $88 right now&mdash;its lowest price yet, according to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/best-price-tracking-tools" target="_blank">price trackers</a>, making it a much more budget-friendly option than usual (it typically goes for $129.99). </p><p>At just 1.4 pounds, with a rcarry strap and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-waterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">IP67</a> water- and dust-proofing, it&rsquo;s built for the outdoors. While it won&rsquo;t win any awards for deep bass, the angled mono drivers and passive radiators do a surprisingly solid job of filling small spaces with crisp audio. It has a control panel with buttons for power, Bluetooth pairing, volume, play, and the ULT bass boost button on top, so you can manage controls directly from the speaker rather than relying on an app. The play button also handles calls and lets you skip tracks.</p><p>That ULT button is Sony&rsquo;s take on bass boost, and it&rsquo;s the main tool for coaxing more punch out of this compact unit. The effect is noticeable but it comes at a cost to battery life. This <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sony-ult-field-1" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a> notes that the estimated 12 hours at moderate volume without the ULT effect drops sharply to about 3 hours if you&rsquo;re blasting it at max volume with the boost turned on. On the plus side, it supports Bluetooth 5.3, multipoint pairing, Google Fast Pair, and works with AAC and SBC <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-are-bluetooth-codecs-a-guide-to-everything-from-aac-to-sbc" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">codecs</a>.

            <title>I Figured Out How to Turn off iOS 26's Annoying New Screenshot Features</title>

            <description>How to get rid of iOS 26's annoying full-screen pop-up when you take a
                screenshot.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In iOS 26, Apple has expanded its <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-visual-intelligence-announcement-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">Visual Intelligence feature from just the camera to the screen</a>. Now, you can use Visual Intelligence to ask anything about what&rsquo;s on your screen, to add events to your Calendar, or to look up images using Google (similar to Google&rsquo;s Circle to Search). All of this is quite cool, but it comes with a redesigned, full-screen screenshot splash screen.</p><p>When all you want to do is take a quick screenshot, seeing this big splash screen and all it new AI buttons can get annoying fast. Plus, you might not want Apple Intelligence to see what&rsquo;s on your screen (which it will now automatically do), no matter how useful these updates might turn out to be.</p><p>Thankfully, you can disable the new splash screen, and go back to the old thumbnail preview method instead. Plus, when needed, you'll still be able to trigger Visual Intelligence, even when using thumbnails.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-the-new-visual-intelligence">What you can do with the new Visual Intelligence</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Since the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-finally-has-image-generation" target="_blank">iOS 18.2 update</a>, you&rsquo;ve been able to use ChatGPT to ask questions about what&rsquo;s on your screen. But with iOS 26 (currently <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">available as a Developer Beta</a> and soon rolling out as a Public Beta), Apple is introducing Automatic Visual Look Up to the mix. This new feature automatically analyzes your screenshot the second it&rsquo;s captured. Then, it pulls in relevant actionable information and adds it below the screenshot.</p><p>For example, if you screenshot is of an invitation to a party, it will show you a one-tap button to add it to your calendar. If your screenshot is of a website, you&rsquo;ll see a link to go there directly. Plus, there&rsquo;s a feature that lets you highlight any image to find similar images on Google, as if you were using <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-ai-features" target="_blank">Circle to Search or Google Lens</a>. </p><h2 id="how-to-disable-the-full-screen-visual-intelligence-splash-screen">How to disable the full-screen Visual Intelligence splash screen </h2><p>If you stick with this new full-screen option for taking screenshots, you&rsquo;ll have to tap twice to save a screenshot every single time you take one. First, you'll have to tap the Checkmark button at the top of the screen, and then choose Save to Photos. That's a big difference to a process that used to be instant.</p><p>Thankfully, Apple has an option to disable the new splash screen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Threads users will soon have more control over what shows up (or doesn't) in their feeds. According to <a href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DLXyHScI2kz?xmt=AQF03CsMcCxVxZLoQ3c2f8buH8qbqxm98lOXn-LSZ442Hg" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a Threads post</a> from Instagram head Adam Mosseri, an update to the platform's Hidden Words feature will allow users to customize which content is filtered out separate from their preferences on Instagram.</p><p>Hidden Words itself isn't new: <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-hide-words-and-phrases-on-your-threads-feed" target="_blank">Threads users can already mute words</a>, phrases, and emojis from their feeds and automatically filter out comments containing offensive language. However, this was a global setting that applied to both Threads and Instagram, so you weren't able to have separate lists of content to hide or customize those filters on Threads. </p><p>Threads is also testing a "mark spoiler" content label to hide spoilers in posts&mdash;unless a user taps to reveal the text or image&mdash;as well as DMs. It also isn't the only platform to increase user control over what content they see: TikTok <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-curate-your-tiktok-for-you-page" target="_blank">recently expanded its settings</a> that allow users to better personalize their For You feeds, including AI-powered keyword filtering. </p><h2 id="how-to-customize-hidden-words-on-threads">How to customize Hidden Words on Threads</h2><p>To edit Hidden Words, open the Threads app, tap your profile icon in the bottom navigation bar, then open the Settings menu from the top-right corner. Go to <strong>Content preferences &gt; Hidden Words</strong>. You can toggle <strong>Hide common offensive words in replies</strong> off or on, which will move replies to a hidden section under your posts (anyone can still tap to show them). </p><p>Under that, you can tap <strong>+ New filter</strong> to hide posts with certain words, phrases, or emojis from your feed as well as replies containing filtered content. Threads has new options to customize filters, such as hiding posts shared by anyone or only profiles you don't follow as well a 30-day "snooze" for filtered content you don't want to permanently hide. Related words can be batched under a single custom filter (spider <em>and</em> spiders, for example).</p><p>Note that the new feature may not be available on your device just yet, so keep an eye out for app updates.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Anthropic rolled out a new feature <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/anthropic-debuts-claude-35-sonnet-with-faster-processing-and-new-features" target="_blank">called Artifacts</a> in its Claude AI chatbot, letting users see real-time results from their conversations&mdash;think diagrams, reports, websites, or code snippets, for example. Now the feature has been given a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/build-artifacts" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">substantial upgrade</a>, letting you create and share AI-powered apps just by describing them.</p><p>The apps you create through this "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">vibe coding"</a> approach can have Claude AI smarts built right inside, and it's available for all users&mdash;so you can give it a try whether you're on a paid subscription or not. And if you share your creation with other people, when they run the app it'll be counted against their Claude usage allowance, not yours.</p><p>One of the examples Anthropic gives is a flashcard app. You could previously get Claude to code you an app showing flashcards, but you'd need to specify all the details and card content yourself. Now, you can leverage Claude's AI to create card content specific to individual users, because they'll be able to give the chatbot prompts about the text they want to see.</p><p>The upgraded feature should be available to everyone now, though you may need to enable it: <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">On the web</a>, click your account name (bottom left), then choose <strong>Settings &gt; Profile</strong> and enable <strong>Create AI-powered artifacts</strong>. You'll see some <a href="https://claude.ai/artifacts" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">examples of apps</a> other people have made, and you can test out any of these in your browser, as well as making changes to them via the <strong>Customize</strong> button.</p><p>Back on the main Artifacts screen, you can see any projects you've previously made, and click <strong>New artifact</strong> to start creating something new. You'll be given some categories to choose from, including <strong>Games</strong>, <strong>Productivity tools</strong>, and <strong>Creative projects</strong>&mdash;but if nothing fits exactly, click <strong>Start from scratch</strong>.</p><h2 id="creating-my-own-app">Creating my own app</h2><p>I haven't done a whole lot of coding since I learnt BASIC back in high school: I used it to code a soccer simulator that picked scores and scorers at random, which was a lot of fun at the time. With Claude's new and improved Artifacts tool available, I was interested to see just how good an app I could make from vibes alone.</p><p>My first thought was to ask Claude what I should create, a worrying reminder that AI is taking away our capacity to think and make decisions ourselves. In the end I used my own brain cells to make a choice: I wanted to make an app to generate quiz questions on any specified topic, with a sliding scale of difficulty and the answers available if needed.</p><p>I explained what I wanted using natural language and zero code: an app that would prompt the user for a topic, then display a question on that topic, with the option to reveal the answer with a click. I also wanted options for adjusting the question difficulty, and switching topics. It actually only took a single prompt to describe everything.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Claude gave me an overview of what it would do before it started building, telling me it loved the vision for my app (I bet it says that to everyone). When I gave the go-ahead, the browser window split to show the app and its raw code on the right (you can toggle between these views with a click).</p><p>The resulting app was pretty great the first time around, certainly in terms of its functionality&mdash;everything worked as I wanted and was well designed. The AI's choice of questions and assessment of their difficulty was a little wonky, however: All the questions had the right answers attached, but the app tended to fixate on a limited set of subjects within each topic (specific movies, actors, or bands, for example).</p><p>It was probably unfair for me to ask for a question about Twin Peaks at child-level difficulty, but "where is Twin Peaks set?" is maybe a little too easy&mdash;and Claude generated the same question at the next difficulty level, too. The hardest question was about the model of tape recorder FBI agent Dale Cooper uses, which had me stumped.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRJBTAD9Y6TQPPTJZQWDK47/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751023741.jpg" alt="Claude AI Artifacts" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRJBTAD9Y6TQPPTJZQWDK47/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1751023741.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRJBTAD9Y6TQPPTJZQWDK47/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1751023741.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYRJBTAD9Y6TQPPTJZQWDK47/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1751023741.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">You can see the code rewritten in real time as you make changes.</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>That's more about the limitations of AI models and their understanding, though. In terms of the actual app building, Claude mostly impressed: It responded to my questions and edits very well, letting me change colors and layouts with simple text prompts. It's cool to see an app being rebuilt in real time, and the AI bot then explains the changes that have been made and why.</p><p>There was one issue with a new "suggested topics" box that Claude took a long time to get right, despite my vibe-debugging attempts. Eventually, it got the box in the right place, but it took multiple iterations to work properly. At times the chatbot interface is too opaque, though the raw code is always available for the serious programmers out there.</p><p>For now, this seems best suited to casual, small-scale projects&mdash;as demonstrated by the examples Anthropic has put in the showcase&mdash;but I can see it being useful for people who want to develop custom tools for admin or productivity. I definitely enjoyed the experience, and felt like I learned quite a bit about coding along the way too, even if the end result was a little glitchy (more down to the AI content than the actual code).</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>If you're an impulse buyer, you know that shopping events like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/about-amazon-october-prime-day-deals" target="_blank">Amazon's upcoming Prime Day</a> can be bad. Even though we <em>know</em> Amazon is using all kinds of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/all-the-ways-amazon-tricks-you-into-spending-more-on-pr-1849158042" target="_blank">manipulation techniques</a> to get us to buy things we don&rsquo;t need, it still works, so this year, try setting your own prices and only choosing things you already <em>want</em> to buy before the big Prime Day sale.

Below is a step-by-step guide to setting your own personal maximum price for any item sold by Amazon:</p><ul><li><p>Identify the items you&rsquo;d like to purchase and throw them into your <a href="https://zdcs.link/pLPXg?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20wishlist&amp;short_url=pLPXg&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon wishlist</a>. Make sure your wishlist is set to &ldquo;public.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Visit the Amazon price-tracking website <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">CamelCamelCamel</a> and make a free account. There are other price-tracking apps and websites that, more or less, do the same thing&mdash;<a href="https://slickdeals.net/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Slick Deals</a>, <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/explore" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Honey</a>, <a href="https://keepa.com/#!" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Keepa</a>, etc.&mdash;so check out this overview of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/best-price-tracking-tools-1692745053" target="_blank">the best price-tracking tools</a> if you want to compare them. Spoiler alert, though: CamelCamelCamel wins.</p></li><li><p>Click &ldquo;import wishlist.&rdquo; (You&rsquo;ll have to copy and paste the URL from your Amazon wishlist.)</p></li><li><p>Once you&rsquo;ve done that, CamelCamelCamel lets you add specific maximum prices (or percentage drops) for everything in your wishlist. Enter the maximum amount you&rsquo;re willing to pay for each item in your list, and then you can tell it to send you an email when any item&rsquo;s price drops to your set spending limit.</p></li><li><p>Ignore all the Prime Big Deal Days hype and wait for the email alert letting you know that your chosen items have become cheap enough for you to buy.</p></li><li><p>Spend the day feeling smug and agree with yourself that you actually <em>are</em> the smartest person alive. Don&rsquo;t even look at Amazon&rsquo;s website. Seriously. Well, maybe just for a second.

Right?</p></li></ul><h2 id="more-ideas-for-imposing-limits-on-your-spending">More ideas for imposing limits on your spending</h2><p>If you want to take tech-based shopping guardrails beyond the basic "time to buy" alert system described above, here are some ideas.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Block ads</strong>: If you're the type of person who responds to online ads, you can block a ton of them with a simple tool or app. Here's our overview of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-ad-blockers" target="_blank">best ad-blocking software</a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Track your expenses:</strong> Whether you do it with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/track-your-spending-using-a-pen-and-paper-1835310590" target="_blank">pencil and paper</a> or <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-expense-tracking-app-is-everydollar-1836710791" target="_blank">use an app</a>, seeing how much you're spending can be a powerful motivation to be more thrifty. Budgeting over time can even give you a bit of a surplus, so you can splurge when Prime Day rolls around if you want to.</p></li><li><p><strong>Save up for something</strong>: Saving up for something in the future&mdash;a vacation, an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-e-bikes-e-scooters-and-e-skateboards" target="_blank">electric surfboard</a>, whatever&mdash;can make it easier to resist spending now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hit your internal pause button:</strong> If you can make a habit of waiting a day or two between thinking "I want those sunglasses" and entering your credit card numbers, you may decide your old sunglasses are just fine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set up a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-use-one-in-one-out-trend-to-declutter-over-time" target="_blank">one-in-one-out system</a></strong>: For everything you buy or acquire, get rid of a similar item (or more!) to make room for it. Knowing something has to go if you hit "buy now" can stop you from making an impulse buy, and following this rule keeps your home less cluttered. Bonus points if you <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-apps-for-selling-clothing" target="_blank">resell an item</a> before getting a similar one. <em>Make </em>money before <em>spending</em> money, and save space while you're at it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consider professional help</strong>: It's normal and common to sometimes have a little difficulty controlling spending, but researchers say about 6% of Americans suffer from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805733/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">compulsive buying disorder</a> which may be part of a larger psychological problem. So if your spending is driving you deep into debt, you're suffering real-world consequences based on your buying habits, or you just feel like shopping might be a problem for you, talk to a professional. </p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As soon as it became safe for me to cook on the stove unsupervised&mdash;say 12 years old?&mdash;I began to fry bacon. I&rsquo;d do my best to stretch out the wobbly strips so they wouldn&rsquo;t overlap or curl up too much and brace myself for the impact of tiny, sharp, popping oil splatters. I loved the results (chewy, crispy bacon is a compelling reward), but I hated the process and the clean-up that followed. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it. But instead of giving up on bacon, I changed my approach. Now I oven bake my bacon and it&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll ever do it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="why-oven-baking-your-bacon-is-best">Why oven-baking your bacon is best</h2><p>Oven-baking is superior to pan frying because you don&rsquo;t have to babysit it, the stovetop is available for other cooking, you&rsquo;re not subject to painful splatters, and cleanup can be a breeze with a simple trick (more on that in a moment). Furthermore, it&rsquo;s an absolute lifesaver if you&rsquo;re hosting a large brunch party and you need to cook three pounds of bacon. You aren&rsquo;t limited to how many slices you can fit in your frying pan. Instead, you can bake as much bacon as you can fit on a large sheet pan. And if your oven has two racks, guess what? You can bake two sheet pans-worth of bacon.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-oven-temperature-is-best-for-bacon">What oven temperature is best for bacon?</h2><p>I usually cook my bacon in a 350&deg;F degree oven for about 20 minutes. The timing will change slightly depending on if you&rsquo;re using thin or thick cut bacon, but that&rsquo;s my go-to temperature. It&rsquo;s hot enough to crisp and brown the bacon within a reasonable amount of time to cook the rest of breakfast, but not so hot where you scorch your precious pork before you know it. I&rsquo;ve always had success at this temperature and I find that it provides a cooking window perfect for catching your bacon at exactly the doneness you like.&nbsp;</p><p>Occasionally, if I&rsquo;m in a rush, I&rsquo;ll bump the temperature to 400&deg;F. However, doing this always comes with the understanding that I may burn it. This temperature is fine and it&rsquo;ll shave five to eight minutes from your overall bake time, but if I&rsquo;m in a rush then my mind is probably in 10 places at once and not on my bacon. I have scorched my meat at this temperature before. If you need bacon fast, try 400&deg;F&mdash;but set a timer.</p><h2 id="how-to-bake-the-best-batch-of-bacon">How to bake the best batch of bacon</h2><p>The steps are simple, and this hands-off method allows you to use the stove top for important business, like pancakes and eggs.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Line the baking sheet</h3><p>As much as I dislike single-use aluminum foil, this is key for cleanup. Pick a medium to small baking sheet and use a single piece of aluminum foil to line it. Use the lip of the pan to shape the foil so that you have four walls. Even if your sheet pan is bigger, you can still use the edges to shape walls, the foil just won&rsquo;t be hugging the sides of the pan and that&rsquo;s fine. The goal is to capture the rendered fat.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<h3>2. Arrange the bacon and bake</h3><p>Within the foil arena you&rsquo;ve made, lay out the strips of bacon. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which direction they go and they can touch side to side, but just make sure they&rsquo;re flat and not overlapping. If they do overlap then you&rsquo;ll have some steam pockets and uneven cooking. For crispy bacon, this is a sin. However, if you like chewy, soft bacon then this might be all right for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Put the sheet of bacon in a preheated 350&deg;F oven and leave it be for 18 to 20 minutes, or until you&rsquo;ve achieved your preferred bacon texture.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<h3>3. Easy clean-up</h3><p>Oven-baked bacon is more evenly cooked and stays flatter compared to pan-fried bacon. In the case of clean-up, baked wins again. Remove the bacon strips from the foil&mdash;they should release easily&mdash;and put them on some paper towels to blot off excess fat, or let them cool on a wire cooling rack.</p><p>Now you have a foil lined baking sheet full of liquid bacon drippings. Yes, you could just lift this up and toss it in the trash, but you might be risking some fat dribble escaping onto the floor or into the trash. Instead, I toss the entire sheet tray into the fridge or freezer for about five minutes to solidify the fat. Now you can lift the foil, crumple it up, and toss it with zero mess.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Alternatively, save your bacon drippings. The rendered fat you capture is an especially delicious ingredient and you can use later in other meals. Simply run the liquid fat through a fine mesh strainer and into a jar.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's iconic Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is dead after 40 years. RIP to the most panic-inducing screen a Windows user can encounter. Now, get ready to fear the Black Screen of Death.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on its website today, the company revealed it's ready to go live with an error screen redesign it's been <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-tests-redesigned-blue-screen-of-death-intended-to-be-less-ominous" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">testing since March</a>. In an update to all Windows 11, version 24H2 devices coming "later this summer," the BSOD will finally be put out of its misery.</p><p>It's likely to be a bittersweet moment for Windows users, who will undoubtedly have mixed feelings about the warning's fate. Despite its ominous name, getting a BSOD wasn't always as serious as it seemed&mdash;a simple crash could trigger it, and restarting could easily fix it. It could be worse than that, too, but in many cases, the old BSOD simply added a bit of personality to the most annoying interruptions to your workflow. Especially in recent years, when you would see a sideways frowning emoticon alongside your error message.</p><p>But sometimes, personality isn't what you need, especially when you're already stressed out about your computer encountering a serious error. Businesses and travelers alike were bombarded with a particularly unsolvable Blue Screen of Death during last year's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-fix-crowdstrike-blue-screen-of-death" target="_blank">extended Crowdstrike outage</a>, so it makes sense why Microsoft might want to move away from any association with it. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Enter the new Black Screen of Death. Looking more like other Windows error messages, this is a simple black screen that says, in white text, that "Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart." Below that is a progress counter, alongside your error code and which process triggered it.</p><p>"The updated UI improves readability and aligns better with Windows 11 design principles," Microsoft Vice President of Enterprise and OS Security David Weston said in today's blog post.</p><p>I'll agree that it's arguably a bit less ominous then the current BSOD, which spends a lot of screen space on that big frowning emoticon, and used to say "Your PC ran into a problem that it couldn't handle" before anything else. Personally, I think the new approach might better reflect most situations that might trigger a BSOD&mdash;they're usually not as scary as they seem. Plus, the old error screen didn't actually tell you which process failed, so seeing that on its replacement is a nice bonus (it would occasionally show a QR code, but I often couldn't get it scanned before my computer restarted).</p><p>Still, part of me will miss the old Blue Screen of Death, in the same way I miss the Red Ring of Death that claimed my first Xbox 360. Stockholm syndrome, I suppose?</p><p>At any rate, Microsoft says that when it releases the new Black Screen of Death (not the official name for the error message, but neither was "Blue Screen of Death"), it will also release a new Quick Machine Recovery feature, which will help you access PCs that can't restart normally. In other words, the company is trying to make sure we won't get another Crowdstrike incident anytime soon. And if we do, it'll hopefully make us feel a little less blue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hideo Kojima's latest package delivery/tar-based afterlife simulator is finally out today. It's also a massive download, like most AAA games these days. If you're impatient, or just want to be a bit more considerate of other people on your network, don't forget that your router can (probably) give your console a bit of a boost.</p><p>Most wifi routers&mdash;including our picks for the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-wi-fi-6-routers" target="_blank"><u>best Wi-Fi 6 routers</u></a> and best <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-mesh-networking-systems" target="_blank"><u>mesh wifi systems</u></a>&mdash;have features that let you prioritize certain devices on your network. Under normal circumstances, your router tries to make sure every device has a roughly equal chance at a solid connection, but by prioritizing certain devices, your router can favor them with faster downloads or more reliable connections.</p><p>This is handy when you're downloading a huge game on a console, since your download speed won't slow down when someone else starts streaming a movie. Conversely, if you're more patient, you can use this feature to prioritize your TV so your streams don't get interrupted while your console chugs away downloading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApWCtAuKcI" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>all that data</u></a>.</p><p>The process for enabling this feature varies by model, but if you have an app to control your routers, you can usually find it in this app's settings. For example, I use a Nest Wifi Pro router. In the Google Home app, you can tap Wifi &gt; Devices, then search for the device you want to prioritize and set it to receive priority for a short duration.</p><p>Some routers also allow you to prioritize certain <em>types</em> of traffic, rather than specific devices. In Eero's app, for example, head to Settings &gt; Network settings, and choose Smart Queue Management (or SQM). This feature lets you prioritize traffic for online gaming, video streaming, or conference calls. If you want to make sure that meeting with your boss doesn't degrade because of the game you're planning to play as soon as the call is done, this can be a handy trick.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has been adding more and more AI features into its apps as of late, whether you asked for them or not. WhatsApp in particular has received a lot of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/instagram-has-official-ai-accounts-and-they-are-weird" target="_blank">Meta's AI attention</a> in recent times, with the addition of a dedicated Meta AI button in the app and the search bar doubling as a place to ask Meta AI to generate text, advice, or jokes. The company continues to push AI into the heart of WhatsApp, as it's now added an optional feature that lets you <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/catch-up-on-conversations-with-private-message-summaries" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">summarize your conversations in the app</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>WhatsApp calls this feature <strong>Message Summaries</strong>, and it's currently rolling out in the U.S. in English. Once it rolls out to you, you'll be able to access it via a <strong>Summarize privately</strong> button at the top of your chat. The company says it's designed to help you catch up with tons of messages without reading every single one of them. </p><p>In theory, this is a good idea. If you're a part of group chats, you'll know that some of them can absolutely spiral out of control. I'm a part of a few such groups, where people post non-stop during Apple events, sports games, or when we want to discuss a fun topic. There have been times when I've woken up to hundreds of unread texts, and I don't always have the time or energy to go through each of these messages myself. For times like these, WhatsApp's AI summaries could help.</p><p>In practice though, there are some legitimate accuracy and privacy concerns here. First, as with all AI, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/bbc-study-shows-how-inaccurate-ai-news-summaries-are" target="_blank">there's always the risk of hallucination</a>, so you might have to double check your summaries anyway. On the privacy front, while WhatsApp is famously end-to-end encrypted, Meta's AI features so far haven't had the same level of security. Given the company's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-keep-your-meta-ai-questions-private" target="_blank">long history of collecting user data</a>, as well as surprises like the recent move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/ads-are-rolling-out-gradually-to-whatsapp/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">bring ads to WhatsApp</a>, it's natural to be skeptical.</p><p>For what it's worth, though, Meta says that the Message Summaries feature does not allow it or WhatsApp to see your messages or the summaries Meta AI generates. "Message Summaries uses Private Processing technology, which allows Meta AI to generate a response without Meta or WhatsApp ever seeing your messages or the private summaries. No one else in the chat can see that you summarized unread messages either," the company says in its blog post announcing this feature. You can read more about how Private Processing works in Meta's <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2025/04/29/security/whatsapp-private-processing-ai-tools/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">engineering blog</a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/private-processing-technical-whitepaper" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">technical whitepaper</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also worth noting that the feature is not enabled by default. Unfortunately, it also doesn't seem to be processed on-device, which would have been even better for your privacy since it would mean that no information leaves your phone, but also would have limited the feature to devices powerful enough to run it.</p><p>Still, I'll be skeptical until I can actually try this myself. If you're like me, you do have options. You can stop anyone from using Meta AI in your WhatsApp chats with them by tapping the name of the contact or group, selecting <strong>Advanced Chat Privacy</strong>, and enabling <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/whatsapp-now-lets-you-block-people-from-exporting-chats" target="_blank">Advanced Chat Privacy</a>. Unfortunately, though, you have to manually do this for every single chat&mdash;there's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-meta-ai-on-facebook-instagram-messenger-whatsapp" target="_blank">no easy way to disable Meta AI entirely</a>.</p><p>While Message Summaries for WhatsApp is already rolling out in English to the U.S., Meta says it'll be made available to users in other countries starting later this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>You Can Still Apply for Your Share of That $126 Million 'Fortnite' Settlement</title>

            <description>The FTC is reopening claims for a Fortnite settlement that could put money
                in your pocket.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In December of last year, the FTC issued a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/you-can-still-file-a-claim-in-the-fortnite-settlement" target="_blank">first round of payments</a> in a 2022 settlement that required <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games to refund $245 million to players. Now, the Commission is re-opening claims, with $126 million up for grabs. Even if you have to split that, the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epic-games-fortnite-ftc-refund/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">average sum for each impacted user in the last round of payments was $114</a>, so this isn't small potatoes. Here's how to get your piece of the pie.</p><h2 id="what-did-epic-games-do">What did Epic Games do?</h2><p>First, some history. Essentially, this all comes down to confusing UI. In 2022, after a legal battle with the Federal Trade Commission, Epic Games agreed to pay a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/fortnite-video-game-maker-epic-games-pay-more-half-billion-dollars-over-ftc-allegations" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">total of $520 million</a> in relief for an alleged violation of COPPA, or the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The FTC accused the company of using "dark patterns" to trick users, especially children, into buying unwanted in-game items. These included button placements that might cause a user to accidentally buy an item they only intended to preview, or to accidentally click a hidden buy button while the game was loading. As a result, Epic agreed to adjust the game's design to address these issues, as well as pay $275 million in penalties and $245 in refunds to players. It's that latter sum that we're concerned with today.</p><h2 id="who-is-eligible-for-a-payment">Who is eligible for a payment?</h2><p>Even if you don't play <em>Fortnite</em> yourself, you could be eligible for a payment. According to the FTC, any of the following groups of people can file a claim for their share of the settlement:</p><ul><li><p>If you were charged in-game <em>Fortnite</em> currency for items you didn't want between January 2017 and September 2022.</p></li><li><p>If your child made <em>Fortnite</em> charges for you without your knowledge between January 2017 and September 2022.</p></li><li><p>If your <em>Fortnite </em>account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 following a complaint about wrongful charges.</p></li></ul><h2 id="do-i-need-to-file-a-claim">Do I need to file a claim?</h2><p>If you have not yet filed a claim, now is your chance. However, if you already filed before the previous deadline of February 14, no action is required on your part. Alongside opening up space for new claims, the FTC also announced that its second round of payments is already underway, with just under 970,000 checks or digital payments currently heading out to those who already filed a valid claim.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-file-a-claim">How do I file a claim?</h2><p>To file a claim for the next round of payments, simply visit <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">this page on the FTC site</a> and click the <strong>Apply for a Refund</strong> button before the new deadline of July 9. You'll need to be over 18 and supply your claim number or Epic Account ID, and then simply fill out if you would like to be paid via check or Paypal. If you already field a claim following the prior cutoff of Feb. 14, you don't need to do anything right now&mdash;that claim will be applied to the next round of payments automatically. If you're under 18, the FTC says a parent or guardian can file a claim on your behalf.</p><h2 id="when-can-i-expect-my-payment">When can I expect my payment?</h2><p>The FTC says the next round of payments should go out in 2026, after the Commission has reviewed and validated all claims. Checks will need to be cashed within 90 days, while PayPal payments will need to be accepted within 30 days.</p><p>Any questions can be sent to <a href="mailto:admin@fortniterefund.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">admin@fortniterefund.com</a> or asked directly via 1-833-915-0880.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>The back-to-school summer shopping season is upon us, with major retailer sales like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/prime-day" target="_blank">Prime Day</a> rolling in, including <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-targets-circle-week-sale" target="_blank">Target's Circle Week sale</a>. If you're here, you've likely had a hard time trying to get hold of someone with a conscience on the other line. It's not easy, but here is the best way I found to get a real customer service representative from Target on the phone.</p><h2 id="the-best-phone-number-for-targets-customer-service-department">The best phone number for Target's customer service department</h2><p>If you Google Target's customer service number, the first number you'll see at the top of the search result is 1-800-440-0680. However, it's hard or even impossible to reach a real person using that number. However, in my experience, if you call <strong>1-800-591-3869</strong>, you <em>can</em> eventually reach a customer service agent. </p><h3>If Target recognizes your phone number</h3><p>The pre-recorded message will automatically pull up your last order from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8NDO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Target.com&amp;short_url=QL8NDO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Target.com</a> and ask if you need help with it. Regardless of why you're calling, <strong>press 1</strong> to confirm you need help with it. You'll be given additional options to narrow down the reason for your call, but if you <strong>don't select an option</strong>, Target will automatically connect you with a live agent on the phone who can help you with anything related to your account.</p><h3>If Target doesn't recognize your phone number</h3><p>If your phone number isn't automatically linked to your account, you'll want to <strong>press 1</strong> to enter your phone number. Once you do, Target will connect you with someone who will verify your information and send you an email verification. Once you finish that, that person will be able to help you answer questions regarding your account.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-speak-with-a-real-person-at-amazon-customer-service" target="_blank">Unlike Amazon</a>, there is no call-back service provided by Target, so calling yourself is the quickest way to get a hold of a real person. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Google is making it easier to use Gemini in several Android apps.</description>
            <media:thumbnail
                url="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYN2QQM9174P0MGXPQH9K722/hero-image.png" />
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Google sent an email to some Gemini users outlining changes in how the AI chatbot will interact with other Android apps, including Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and Utilities. Initially, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-apps-activity-email-july-7-3570651/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the message was interpreted</a> to mean that Gemini would potentially have more access to user data, but it turns out the update <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/upcoming-gemini-for-android-change-privacy-settings/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">may not actually threaten privacy</a>&mdash;and could in fact be an improvement.</p><h2 id="whats-changing-with-gemini-app-permissions">What's changing with Gemini app permissions</h2><p>The email states that Gemini will be able to "help you use" the above apps regardless of whether Gemini Apps Activity is enabled, though users can turn these features off in the Apps setting page. The update is set to roll out automatically beginning on July 7. </p><p>When <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13278892?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Cin-the-gemini-mobile-app" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Gemini Apps Activity is on</a>, Google stores your Gemini history, including conversations with Gems and Gemini Live chats, in your Google account. Previously, if this setting was disabled, you weren't able to use Messages, Phone, Utilities, or WhatsApp extensions in Gemini, meaning you <em>had</em> to allow Google to save and store your conversations if you wanted to take advantage of AI features. </p><p>The update appears to allow you to access Gemini's functionality in these apps even if you have Gemini Apps Activity turned off, so you don't lose anything by declining to have your chats stored and used in various ways. </p><p>It makes sense to have concerns about what engaging with AI means for your privacy. Earlier this month, we covered <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-keep-your-meta-ai-questions-private" target="_blank">the nightmare that is Meta AI's default</a> data privacy settings, and we already know that your chatbot interactions are used not only to train and improve the models but <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-conversations-with-chatbots-are-not-private" target="_blank">may also be reviewed by humans</a>. It's also unlikely most users are actually reading privacy policies or digging through settings to ensure their data isn't being scraped, stored, or shared in ways they may not consent to if they were. But this update doesn't appear to further compromise your privacy and data security when using Gemini. </p><h2 id="how-to-disable-gemini-apps-activity">How to disable Gemini Apps Activity</h2><p>Gemini Apps Activity is enabled by default for users over 18. You can turn it off in the Gemini app by tapping your profile picture or initial followed by <strong>Gemini Apps Activity &gt; Turn off &gt; Turn off</strong> or <strong>Turn off and delete activity</strong>. Note that Google still stores your Gemini interactions on its servers for up to 72 hours when Gemini Apps Activity is off, but the activity won't appear in your account. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Meta is trying to fix a glitch that's wiped innocent Facebook groups from
                the site.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook users are complaining that their groups are inexplicably getting hit with the ban hammer, no matter how innocent they are. Across Reddit and X, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1ljdh9r/my_group_birds_with_threatening_auras_with_927k/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">birders</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1ljdtb7/everyone_be_sure_to_raise_a_massive_stink_about/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Pok&eacute;mon trainers</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1ljgg31/facebook_group_with_over_3_million_members/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">interior designers</a> are complaining that their groups are being deleted, with seemingly no regard to the content posted to them or how large they are. In some cases, such as the aforementioned interior design group, these now-deleted pages had millions of members before being shut down.</p><p>Reasons given for the bans vary between groups, from accusations that they hosted "terrorism-related" content to claims of "nudity and adult sexual content." Listen, I know a titmouse is a funny name for a bird, but this is going a bit far.</p><p>On the odd chance you thought that Facebook's pet memes or parenting groups did indeed hold some sinister secret, I'll disabuse you of that notion right now: This is a bug. An official cause has yet to be tracked down (although users on social media are blaming AI moderation), but Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/facebook-group-admins-complain-of-mass-bans-meta-says-its-fixing-the-problem/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">TechCrunch</a> that the company is aware of the problem and are in the process of fixing. </p><p>This news follows <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-shadowbanning-creators" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">recent mass complaints</a> about "shadowbanning" on Instagram, where site head Adam Mosseri attempted to emphasize the company's commitment to transparency in its moderation process. Regardless, it's unclear at this point when a fix might arrive for affected Facebook groups, and if it's possible to restore them to their previous status.</p><p>In the meantime, admins are taking action. One <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chrismoorephotos" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">class-action lawsuit</a> is already underway, and multiple Change.org petitions are <a href="https://www.change.org/p/meta-wrongfully-disabling-accounts-with-no-human-customer-support" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">garnering thousands of signatures</a>. While not being able to chat with like-minded users or see funny pictures might just be a small interruption for some, for business owners, losing access to their audiences can significantly impact their livelihood.</p><p>I've reached out to Meta for additional clarification but have not yet heard back. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon's biggest sale of the year is right around the corner. As you're checking out <a href="https://lifehacker.com/prime-day" target="_blank">the deals during Amazon's super-sized Prime Day</a>&mdash;which will take place from July 8 to July 11, twice as long as usual&mdash;you might be tempted by Amazon's "affordable monthly payment system." Also known as "buy now, pay later" (BNPL), its pitch is alluring: Buy what I need now, and pay later, "<a href="https://pay.amazon.com/using-amazon-pay/affirm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">on my own timeline</a>?" Yes please! But as convenient as it sounds, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-apple-pay-later" target="_blank">you should think twice</a> before using buy now, pay later options for Prime Day.</p><p>While BNPL plans can allow you to pay for purchases in installments without interest, they come with a cost can easily outweigh any Prime Day discounts. At least 16% of consumers using BNPL have missed payments, and 24% have said theoption caused them to overspend, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/buy-now-pay-later-survey/#insights" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>according to a recent Bankrate survey</u></a>. Let's take a look at the hidden costs of BNPL, and why you're better off paying upfront for all your Prime Day deals.</p><h2 id="how-does-amazons-buy-now-pay-later-option-work">How does Amazon's buy now, pay later option work?</h2><p>Amazon <a href="https://pay.amazon.com/using-amazon-pay/affirm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">doesn't actually have its own</a> buy now, pay later program. Instead, they've partnered up with major BNPL provider <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q476WA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;amp%3Btemplate=Explainers&amp;amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp;amp%3Belement=offer&amp;amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp;amp%3Belement_label=Affirm%2C&amp;amp%3Bshort_url=Q476WA&amp;amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fthe-pros-and-cons-of-apple-pay-later&amp;amp%3Bevent_label=Affirm%2C&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Affirm.&amp;short_url=Q476WA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Affirm.</u></a> When you're checking out on Amazon, you can select Affirm as a payment. The process is straightforward: you choose your items, select Affirm at checkout, complete a quick application, and receive an instant decision on your loan terms. Individual transactions initiated through Affirm are limited to $25,000, with a daily maximum of $100,000 across multiple purchases&mdash;but hopefully that won't come up in a single Prime Day splurge, right? (<em>Right?!</em>)</p><p>The main draw of these programs is the ability to "pay at your own pace." If you are required to pay a down payment, that is due at the time of the transaction. From there, your first monthly payment is usually due one month after your purchase is processed.  Each following payment will be due one month later, on the same day of the month. </p><p>You can choose your own timeline, usually spanning 3, 6, 12, or 24 months, depending on the purchase amount and your creditworthiness. Unlike traditional credit cards, Affirm shows you the exact payment amount and total cost upfront, and claims no hidden fees or compound interest. (More on that below.)</p><p>Of course, you need a separate Affirm account in addition to your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/is-amazon-prime-worth-it" target="_blank">Amazon Prime membership</a>. The application process requires basic information including your name, mobile phone number, date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social Security number. Affirm performs a soft credit check initially, which doesn't impact your credit score, though they may conduct a hard inquiry for some loans.</p><p>Now let's take a look at four major risks to consider before you hit that BNPL button: </p><h2 id="it-makes-impulse-spending-easier">It makes impulse spending easier</h2><p>The ease of this sort of financing can make expensive purchases feel more affordable than they actually are. When you can buy a <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62RJd?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=%24800%20tablet&amp;short_url=z62RJd&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">$800 tablet</a> for "just $67 per month," it's easy to lose sight of the total cost, as well as your overall financial picture. In turn, this makes it all too easy to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/biggest-tech-discounted-brand-prime-day" target="_blank">overspend on items</a> you might not have purchased otherwise. You're better off taking a breath, stepping away from your shopping cart, and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-set-your-own-prices-for-amazon-prime-day-and-wh-1849158967" target="_blank">setting alerts</a> to be notified when a product hits a price you can stomach.</p><h2 id="you-may-be-hit-with-unexpected-interest-charges">You may be hit with unexpected interest charges </h2><p>The biggest danger with BNPL is missing one of the recurring payments. Sure, the plans are marketed as interest-free financing. However, in many cases, that 0% interest offer only applies if you pay off the full balance by a specific due date. If you have even $1 remaining after that cutoff, interest starts accruing at rates <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buy-now-pay-later-loans-interest-rate-fees-tips-what-to-know/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">as high as 36.99%</a> in some cases. So buyer beware&mdash;it's easy to inadvertently end up with large interest charges if you're not vigilant about paying off the balance before the promotional period ends. Soon that discounted Prime Day deal won't look so affordable.</p><h2 id="it-can-impact-your-credit-score">It can impact your credit score</h2><p>Currently, BNPL plans don&rsquo;t directly impact users&rsquo; credit scores. But this fall, <a href="https://investors.fico.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fico-unveils-groundbreaking-credit-scores-incorporate-buy-now" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">FICO says</a> it will start including BNPL payment histories in its credit score calculations. So if you miss payments or default on the installment plan, it will cause damage to your credit score&mdash;making it even harder to get approved for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and other financing down the road. None of that risk is worth the Prime Day savings.</p><h2 id="youll-have-limited-purchase-protections">You'll have limited purchase protections </h2><p>When you use a credit card, you get valuable purchase protections like extended warranty coverage, price protection, and the ability to dispute fraudulent charges. BNPL plans generally don't come with these safeguards. This means you're on the hook if something goes wrong with your Prime Day purchase and the retailer doesn't make things right. The smarter move is to only buy what you can afford during Amazon's Prime Day event, no matter how tempting those deals may seem.</p><p>Although installment plans are helpful if you really need to finance something major, it&rsquo;s best to avoid taking on debt for everyday expenses. Better to wait for a good price for something you truly need and can afford to pay for right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By putting the right <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/googles-latest-android-update-patches-46-security-flaws" target="_blank">security protections</a> in place and applying some common sense caution, you can minimize the risk of your phone getting hacked&mdash;but it's not something you can ever 100 percent guarantee you're going to be able to avoid. With that in mind, it helps to know what some of the warning signs of a hack might look like, and what you can do in response.</p><p>There are a few different scenarios that the term "hack" covers, so I'll go through them in turn, even if there is some overlap in what you need to be looking out for. Should you be unlucky enough to have your device compromised, by spotting it and fixing it as quickly as possible, you can limit the damage.</p><h2 id="the-spyware-hack">The spyware hack</h2><p>When it comes to phone hacks, the first scenario that would come to mind for most of us is probably someone else gaining control of our device: recording what's being said into the phone mic, perhaps, or recording keystrokes on the keyboard.</p><p>On modern-day smartphones, it's quite difficult to carry out a hack like this remotely&mdash;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-spyware-warning-is-real" target="_blank">though by no means impossible</a>. Exploits can be carried out via an instant message, or through an app that isn't doing what it says it will do, assuming it's sneaked past Apple and Google's checks (or you've sideloaded it).</p><p>If an unscrupulous coworker or partner has managed to get physical access to your phone, the hack is easier to carry out. They might be able to install and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-finally-lock-and-hide-your-apps-on-iphone" target="_blank">hide an app</a> without your knowledge, though even then it will need to get past the built-in security checks put in place by Android and iOS.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>For exploits of this type, there are a few warning signs to look out for that suggest hidden app activity: battery drain that's faster than usual, apps being slow to load or crashing regularly, and your phone unexpectedly running out of storage space. Both Android and iOS should also alert you whenever the mic or camera is in use, so watch for any unexpected activations.</p><p>If you think something is wrong, it's worth browsing through the apps list to see if there's anything you don't recognize: Tap <strong>Apps</strong> from Settings on either Android or iOS. You can uninstall anything suspicious from the same list.</p><p>For a more thorough clean-up, you can reset your phone, which should wipe out any spyware or unwanted apps at the same time&mdash;just make sure you have all your files and data backed up safely first, because the device will go back to its original state. On Android, choose <strong>System &gt; Reset options &gt; Erase all data (factory reset)</strong> from Settings; on iOS, you need to pick <strong>General &gt; Transfer or Reset iPhone &gt; Erase All Content and Settings</strong> from Settings.</p><h2 id="the-account-hack">The account hack</h2><p>Another type of hack is the account hack, where someone else gains access to your apps or accounts. This can expose your data on your computers and on the web too, as well as affecting your phone. Your login credentials may have shown up in a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/its-time-to-kill-the-password" target="_blank">data breach</a>, or they may have been tricked out of you by a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/dont-fall-for-this-new-gmail-phishing-scheme" target="_blank">phishing scam</a>.</p><p>As with the previous hack, what you need to look out for is suspicious activity, though it might not always be obvious: files or emails appearing and disappearing when they shouldn't, for example, or alerts about your account that you didn't expect.</p><p>There are a few ways to dig a bit deeper for signs that your accounts may have been compromised. One is to open up your apps with a "recent" or "activity" view first: You can do this in Google Drive, and in your iCloud Drive account. Everything you see should correspond with actions you've taken.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP8H0C68Z59HHX0T105G4QM/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1750946316.jpg" alt="Instagram logins" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP8H0C68Z59HHX0T105G4QM/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1750946316.jpg 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP8H0C68Z59HHX0T105G4QM/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1750946316.jpg 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP8H0C68Z59HHX0T105G4QM/images-2.fill.size_2000x1125.v1750946316.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">
            </div>
            <div class="mt-2">
                            <span class="mt-2 font-akshar text-sm tracking-wide">Viewing active logins for Instagram.</span>

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>You can also check to see which devices your account is active on, which will tell you if someone has logged in as you on a phone, tablet, or computer you don't own. Most accounts now let you do this in some way or another&mdash;for example, you can <a href="https://accountscenter.instagram.com/password_and_security/login_activity/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">head here</a> to see everywhere your Instagram account is active. The same page lets you set up alerts for new logins and revoke access from any device you can't identify.</p><p>Keep an eye on your email inbox, too, to see if you've got any warnings about unexpected activity on your account&mdash;though note that this will only work if your accounts are connected to email addresses that are active and regularly checked.</p><p>If you think one of your accounts has been compromised, change the login details as soon as you can, which should lock out any unwelcome visitors. You should also <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/two-factor-authentication-can-fail-you" target="_blank">enable two-factor authentication</a> for all the accounts that offer it, which means hackers need more than a username and password to gain access.</p><h2 id="the-sim-or-esim-hack">The SIM or eSIM hack</h2><p>Hackers can also target the SIM in your phone, whether it's a physical SIM card or an eSIM. The newer eSIM standard, where digital registration is used instead of an actual card, is the safer option but it still doesn't offer 100 percent guaranteed protection.</p><p>The most common type of attack here <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/spot-a-sim-swap-attack-and-what-to-do-next" target="_blank">is a SIM swapping attack</a> (also known as a SIM jacking attack): Essentially, your cell number is rerouted to another SIM, and another phone. Someone else will be getting your calls, your texts, and your security codes if you've set them up over SMS.</p><p>This can be done with physical SIMs and eSIMs, and usually involves a hacker convincing your carrier that they're actually you&mdash;and that you want to get your number switched to a new device. They'll need some kind of personal information or login credentials to do this, and they may even compromise the account you've got with your network provider (as described above).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>As well as being a potentially damaging hack, this is also one that you should spot pretty quickly: It will look like your friends and family are ignoring you, because you won't get any calls or texts, and you won't be able to send any either.</p><p>You might also get alerts from your carrier, over email or in-app messages, asking to confirm certain security changes. Be on the lookout for these, as well as any sudden changes in service (like having no cell signal in areas where you can usually connect).</p><p>If a SIM swap happens to you, act as quickly as you can. Change the passwords on accounts connected to your number, and speak to your cell carrier or eSIM provider company at the earliest opportunity&mdash;even if you have to borrow someone else's phone to do it. Once you've proven that you are actually you, the company you're in touch with should be able to reverse the changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've mostly been really happy with my <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/m1-macbook-air-is-best-mac" target="_blank">M1 MacBook Air (2020)</a>, which I've been using for nearly three years now. However, I regret not going for the variant with 16GB of RAM. The base M1 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM is a lot faster, cooler, and lasts longer than the Intel MacBook Air I used before it, but the newer laptop still occasionally slows down when I open too many browser tabs. Luckily, I did some troubleshooting and fixed the problem, and I'm here to share what I've learned with you. So, if Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari or other browsers are slowing down on your computer, try some of these tips to nip that problem in the bud.</p><h2 id="identify-whats-causing-the-slowdown">Identify what's causing the slowdown</h2><p>This is the hardest part of a browser slowdown, because quite often, there's no definitive answer to what the root problem is. It could be because you have an old and slow computer, or because you have too many open tabs that you never close, or because an extension is interfering with something, or a combination of multiple factors. To narrow down the list of possible issues, I recommend the golden rule of troubleshooting: deal with one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that you should start by quitting all other apps, running just one browser with one tab, and then seeing if the slowdown is still present. If your browser works fine when you have one or two tabs open, and slows down once you open multiple tabs, that could point to an issue with the browser. If the browser works fine on its own, but slows down when you have other apps running, then the issue could be with a different app, or it could be a hardware limitation. </p><p>If, after some troubleshooting, your browser really is the issue, then here's what you can do to fix it.</p><h2 id="use-your-browsers-task-manager">Use your browser's task manager</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP50GVSCM27Q61X8DYQANWN/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1750944787.png" alt="Chrome Task Manager showing open tabs and their RAM/CPU usage." width="2000" height="1124" loading="lazy" srcset="https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP50GVSCM27Q61X8DYQANWN/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1750944787.png 800w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP50GVSCM27Q61X8DYQANWN/images-1.fill.size_1400x787.v1750944787.png 1400w, https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JYP50GVSCM27Q61X8DYQANWN/images-1.fill.size_2000x1124.v1750944787.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>Video streaming or web apps can lead to browser slowdowns, but the easiest way to confirm this is by using your browser's built-in task manager. Yes, your browser usually has a separate task manager, which lets you see which of its tabs are causing problems. In Firefox, accessing it as as simple as pressing <strong>Shift-Esc</strong>. Alternatively, you can click the three lines button in the top-right corner and go to <strong>More tools &gt; Task Manager</strong>. You can even type about:processes in the address bar to do the same thing.</p><p>In Chrome (and derivatives such as Edge and Brave), you'll need to press the three dots button in the top-right corner, then go to <strong>More Tools &gt; Task Manager</strong>. Unfortunately, Safari doesn't have a built-in task manager, but you can open the Activity Monitor app on your Mac and type Safari in the search bar to view the process linked to each open tab and determine which one is causing a slowdown.&nbsp;</p><p>Opening the browser's task manager is one thing, but it's also important to know what to look for once you have it open. Your browser's task manager shows you each tab's CPU and RAM usage, and you can use that information to determine the problem. If a tab's taking up too much of either, close the tab to see if it makes a difference. Usually, this does the trick.</p><h2 id="close-unused-tabs">Close unused tabs</h2><p>That brings me to my next bit of advice: please, just close those tabs you opened five years ago. You're never going to get to them and you're not losing anything by closing them. This applies to me as much as it does to anyone else, so I'll be the first to admit my sins. I had a <em>Persona 5</em> game guide open three years ago, when I played the game for 120-odd hours for the second time. I stopped playing the game before I reached the true ending (for a second time), but I still had the game guide tab open until a couple months ago. It wasn't doing anything or consuming too many resources, but when my browser slowed down, I had to let it go. I've accepted that I'll probably never finish the game, or read any of the various articles I have open in my other older tabs, or watch any of those videos I meant to get to. Closing all those inactive tabs helped speed up my browsers significantly.</p><p>If you're still not ready to let go of your tabs, then you can also easily <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-save-all-your-open-tabs-in-safari-chrome-firefox" target="_blank">save all open tabs in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari</a>.</p><h2 id="delete-unused-extensions">Delete unused extensions</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I love using browser extensions to add useful features to my internet experience, but the extra steps they ask of your browser can sometimes cause slowdowns. This is especially true for extensions you no longer use, and deleting unused and potentially cumbersome extensions is good for performance (and your privacy, because extensions often require access to all your open pages). To quickly delete an old extension, open the <strong>about:addons</strong> page in Firefox, <strong>chrome://extensions</strong> page in Chrome and its derivatives, or click the <strong>Safari</strong> button in the menu bar and navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Extensions</strong>.</p><p>I've also found some value in disabling extension only on specific webpages. As someone who suffers from migraines, I rely on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/use-dark-reader-to-force-all-websites-into-dark-mode-1847721424" target="_blank">Dark Reader</a> to force every website to open in dark mode. Bright backgrounds trigger my headaches, which often end up ruining entire days, so I need to be careful with screen brightness and how webpages appear. However, Dark Reader was slowing down some tabs, and I found that disabling it for those specific webpages helped fix the problem.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="restart-the-browser-and-your-computer">Restart the browser (and your computer)</h2><p>Sometimes, the solution to a slowdown is as simple a quick restart, which will give faulty processes a chance to correct themselves. You can try quitting the browser, restarting your computer, and launching the browser again to see if your issue is fixed. This is quite easy to do, but it's easy to forget the simplest and most obvious solutions, so I thought it was worth mentioning this here as well.</p><h2 id="update-your-browser">Update your browser</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The problem isn't always your computer, open tabs, or extensions. Sometimes, it may be a bug in the browser's code, which could cause a memory leak or use too much of your CPU's resources to run the app. There's nothing you can do to fix this, except ensure that your browser is updated to its newest version. Most browsers are usually quite good at updating themselves, but if you notice you're on an older version, you can update manually, too.</p><p>I'll start with my go-to browsers. To update Firefox in Windows, click the three lines button in the top-right corner and select <strong>Help &gt; About Firefox</strong>. On Mac, hit the <strong>Firefox</strong> button in the menu bar and select <strong>About Firefox</strong>. You can update Chrome (or its derivatives) by selecting the three dots button, then clicking <strong>Help &gt; About Chrome</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>To update Safari on your Mac, you need to update macOS itself. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of the screen and go to <strong>System Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>.</p><h2 id="reduce-ads-and-tracking">Reduce ads and tracking</h2><p>Ads and trackers are increasing on almost every website, which tends to increase page loading times and can lead to browser slowdowns, too. You can counter this by using an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/change-these-ublock-origin-settings-for-even-more-priva-1848995058" target="_blank">adblocker such as uBlock Origin</a> on Firefox and Chrome, and one of many <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-best-safari-ad-blockers-of-2022-1849902684" target="_blank">good adblockers for Safari</a>. You could also consider using <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-paid-vpns" target="_blank">a VPN with adblocking built-in</a> or a good DNS service such as <a href="https://nextdns.io" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">NextDNS</a>. Any of these alternatives should reduce how often sites phone home, and how many trackers and other resource-heavy elements are loaded on webpages, which has a direct effect on your browser's performance (and security).</p><h2 id="clear-cookies-and-data">Clear cookies and data</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You could also see a performance improvement by clearing cookies and browser data. Be aware that doing so will require you to log in to your commonly visited websites the next time you visit them, and could also clear your browser's history. If you're okay with that, then you can try this as another option to speed up your browser.</p><p>In Firefox, click the three lines button in the top-right corner and go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security</strong>. In the <strong>Cookies &amp; Data</strong> section, select <strong>Clear Data&hellip;</strong> and confirm when asked. Next, go to the <strong>History</strong> section and click <strong>Clear History&hellip;</strong>.</p><p>In Chrome, click the three-dots button in the top-right corner and go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; Delete browsing data</strong>. Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, check all the options you want to clear, and select <strong>Delete data</strong>.</p><p>In Safari on your Mac, go to the <strong>Safari</strong> menu from the menu bar and select <strong>Clear History&hellip;</strong> to remove browsing history. Then, go to <strong>Safari menu &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Manage Website Data&hellip;</strong>. Here, You can either select and remove individual websites' data, or select all and remove everything.</p><h2 id="check-the-ambient-temperature">Check the ambient temperature</h2><p>Ambient temperatures are rising across the world. Particularly in the summer, you could be using your computer in a hot room and experiencing slowdowns as a result. Modern computers have a thermal cutoff built-in, and if a device gets too hot, it will slow down at first, before shutting down entirely in order to protect your machine. This isn't going to slow down just your browser, though. Everything you do on your computer will run slower than usual if it's too hot where you are. You can try using a laptop cooler, an air conditioner, or other methods to cool down your computer. You'll see an immediate performance improvement once the computer is running at a lower temperature.</p><h2 id="consider-upgrading-your-computer">Consider upgrading your computer</h2><p>Finally, if none of these solutions are working in the long run, then the problem may just be with the hardware you're using. Even cheap upgrades like replacing a hard drive with an SSD or adding more RAM could help, but in a lot of cases, you might want to get a brand new computer. I don't enjoy telling anyone to spend more money to solve problems, but sometimes that really is the only option.&nbsp;</p><p>Buying my M1 MacBook Air was a solid decision in 2022, and at the time, even though my friends and family members chipped in to help, I couldn't afford the 16GB RAM variant. The next time I buy a computer, I'll ensure that it has a little more RAM than I need, so that browser slowdowns and other performance issues don't surface, at least for the first few years of the computer's life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iPhone&rsquo;s Clock app is one of the slowest moving apps on iPhone. It gets less love and attention than even the Phone app. While there are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-alarm-clock-apps-android-ios" target="_blank">many novel and interesting alarm apps out there</a>, Apple&rsquo;s default offering remains quite basic and un-customizable.</p><p>With iOS 26, Apple is bringing customization to one much requested feature. You can now finally get out of snooze jail. Until now, the snooze duration for alarms was set to nine minutes, and you couldn't adjust it. It was either nine minutes or nothing.</p><p>I, personally, like to snooze in five-minute increments. So, I got around this by setting six different alarms, all at five-minute intervals, to help me get up in the morning. But now, I can finally put this chaos aside.</p><h2 id="snooze-as-you-wish">Snooze as you wish</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In iOS 26, which is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">currently out in developer beta</a> (and will soon be out as a public beta preview), you can now set the snooze duration to last anywhere between one minute (if you want to really annoy yourself), and 15 minutes (if time is merely a philosophical construct for you). Finally, I can set my snooze to that five minute sweet spot.</p><p>Sadly, these changes are on a per-alarm basis, so you&rsquo;ll have to customize your snooze every time you set a new alarm. Hopefully, though, I won&rsquo;t have to set nearly as many alarms now as I did before.</p><p>To customize your snooze duration in iOS 26, open the Clock app, go to the <strong>Alarms</strong> tab, and tap the <strong>Plus</strong> icon to create a new alarm. Or, you can tap on an alarm you already have.</p><p>Then, tap the <strong>Snooze Duration</strong> option and choose any duration between one and 15 minutes. Tap the <strong>Done</strong> checkmark at the top to save the new alarm.</p><p>The next time the alarm goes off, you&rsquo;ll see a new alarm screen, with two equally big, beautiful buttons for snooze and stop. In previous versions of the app, you&rsquo;d only see a snooze button in the middle, and a small Stop button below.</p><p>And hey, if you&rsquo;re a bit hardcore, like my colleague Pranay, you can also <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-iphones-alarm-doesnt-need-to-have-a-snooze-button" target="_blank">disable the Snooze button altogether</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The included keyboard snaps on securely and makes typing feel comfortable, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpvE1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Slim%20Pen%202&amp;short_url=zjpvE1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Slim Pen 2</a> works well for note-taking or sketching, and charges while docked in the keyboard, so it&rsquo;s always ready.</p><p>The bonus year of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgvR3?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Microsoft%20365%20Personal&amp;short_url=QKgvR3&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Microsoft 365 Personal</a> adds even more value (you don&rsquo;t need to budget separately for Office apps or cloud storage), especially if you&rsquo;re already paying for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneDrive separately.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re older than, let&rsquo;s say, 28, there&rsquo;s a decent chance you feel completely baffled by what younger people are doing off and online&mdash;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/series/out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">I write about youth trends for a living</a>, and I still don't really know; you <em>can't </em>fully know unless you're in it. The culture of 2025 is so fractured, ironic, algorithm-driven, and contradictory, it can feel alien, even fictional to outsiders. But on the other hand, we're all people, and the human spirit persists, even as it's being bent into impossible shapes by machines, greed, and carelessness. To help make some sense of it all&mdash;or at least give you a list of things to Google&mdash;here&rsquo;s a snapshot of trends shaping Generations Z and A in the middle of 2025. </p><h2 id="amialive-core">AmIAlive Core</h2><p>Coined by writer <a href="https://1234kyle5678.substack.com/p/am-i-alive-am-i" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick</a>, "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-what-is-amialivecore" target="_blank">AmIAlive core</a>" isn't a well-known term among young people, but if there's a single concept that describes how Generations Z differs from previous generations, I thinks it's this. To simplify it: AmIAlive Core posits that young people don&rsquo;t live life, they perform it, so they are subconsciously unsure if they are actually living human beings. Living entirely mediated lives in which "experiences" happen in video games and the outside world is seen through the vertical window of TikTok videos has made it impossible for young people to live authentically, so they play-act life and adopt styles and philosophies based on whether they think is compelling content. A vacation is a chance to pose for exotic Instagram pictures. A concert is a chance to whip out your phone instead of dancing. It's bleak, but that's where we are. </p><h2 id="the-death-and-continued-life-of-tiktok">The death (and continued life) of TikTok</h2><p>If there's a shared common space for Generations A and Z, it's the social media platform TikTok, and TikTok has been going through some things. In January 2024, the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" went into effect. It required that ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) either sell the app to a U.S. company or cease operations in the U.S. by January 19, 2025. In response, TikTok briefly went dark in the United States on the deadline date. For young people, the death of TikTok would be like losing a shared universe; a world would die. Some responded by flocking to other social media outlets like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-rednote" target="_blank">RedNote</a> or lashing out in anger at the government. But luckily, nothing happened&mdash;yet. President Trump announced a 75-day hold to allow ByteDance to find a buyer. That was extended by 90 days on June 15 via executive order, leaving a platform in limbo: technically alive, but existentially shaky. </p><h2 id="ai-everything">AI everything</h2><p>The merciless cultural takeover that is artificial intelligence is affecting everyone, but no group will feel its impact more than Gen Z and Gen A. They are the first to grow up chatting with AI, learning from it, competing against it, and questioning it in real time. Whatever AI becomes, they&rsquo;ll inherit it and help shape it.  Artificial intelligence is already being used to cheat at school, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/current-trends-explained-sharking-y2k-nostalgia-jersey-shore-nails" target="_blank">spread religion</a>, make jokes about Bigfoot, and create disturbing videos featuring kittens. Meanwhile, a growing contingent of young people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiai/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">rejecting AI entirely,</a> particularly when it comes to AI art. Prediction: Serious resistance against AI will grow among younger people. </p><h2 id="the-8020-rule-and-the-gender-wars">The 80/20 Rule and the gender wars</h2><p>Social and cultural conflict over gender roles is definitely not new, but Generations Z and A are adding a unique spin to the morass, most visibly with the 80/20 Rule. Put simply, the 80/20 rule is an axiom that states 80% of women are attracted to only 20% of men. The 80/20 Rule is discussed, memed, and repeated so often in online spaces for lonely dudes that's it's rarely questioned, even though it's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-is-the-80-20-rule-the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture" target="_blank">pretty much total nonsense</a>. </p><h2 id="burning-chromebooks-and-other-dangerous-fads">Burning Chromebooks and other dangerous fads</h2><p>Young people have always been attracted to dumb, dangerous stunts, and there was a time when many of them were amplified by social media sites, particularly TikTok. These days, though, TikTok locks down fads like "The Skull-Breaker Challenge" with ruthless efficiency. But the trend of destroying school laptops slipped through the cracks for a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/why-kids-are-burning-their-school-chromebooks" target="_blank">couple of weeks as the school year ended</a>. That these cheap laptops were the target of mindless teenage vandalism makes sense&mdash;they're an instantly recognizable symbol of educational conformity, circa 2025. </p><h2 id="nostalgia-for-the-early-2000s">Nostalgia for the early 2000s</h2><p>People are usually nostalgic for a more innocent age, but young people's fascination with the early 2000s seems to indicate the opposite. Through the lens of a teenager in 2025, the politically incorrect, crass, no-apologies pop culture of the early aughts represents a kind of lost freedom. "Back then, you could do whatever you wanted without being canceled, arrested, or ridiculed," is the vibe. Obviously this isn't entirely true, but there's <em>something</em> to it. Most people didn't have smart phones back then, so it really was the last time kids could do stupid things and not be immediately posted on Instagram. </p><p>2000s nostalgia goes hand-in-hand with:</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-neo-puritanism">The rise of neo-puritanism</h2><p>Kids may be yearning for wilder times, but they're mostly keeping their impulses in check. The trend of children being more behaviorally conservative than their parents and grandparents continued unabated in the first half of the year. Young people <a href="https://time.com/7203140/gen-z-drinking-less-alcohol/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">drink less</a>, <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/tobacco-trends-brief/overall-smoking-trends" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">smoke less</a>, do <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/is-teen-drug-and-alcohol-use-declining/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">less drugs</a>, and have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-03/young-adults-less-sex-gen-z-millennials-generations-parents-grandparents" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">less sex </a>than previous generations. Whether these trends are due to a greater concern for personal well-being or the result of a locked-down culture and lack of freedom is up for debate, but the numbers speak for themselves. </p><h2 id="millennial-green-and-millennial-burger-joints">Millennial green and Millennial burger joints</h2><p>While there isn't much evidence of the kind of massive cultural generation gap that separated children and parents in the 1960s, that doesn't mean today's young people aren't turning a withering eye on the previous generation. Some may be trying to mimic the early 2000s, but others want to make sure older people know ridiculous they are, whether it's the millennial fascination with Harry Potter, the boring, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/100-humans-vs-one-gorilla" target="_blank">beige and green decorating aesthetic</a> that defined the era, or the faux-hipster folksiness of "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-cookie-king-brain-rot" target="_blank">millennial burger joints</a>."</p><h2 id="men-vs-a-gorilla">100 men vs. a gorilla</h2><p>This meme is based on a simple but compelling question. Who would win in a fight to the death: 100 regular guys or a single gorilla? There are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/100-humans-vs-one-gorilla" target="_blank">many theories</a>, but no ethical way to answer the question. The meme sits at the intersection of absurdist humor, male insecurity, and simulation-brain thinking. I'm not sure why, exactly, but it feels revelatory about the younger generation in the same inexplicable way the popularity of "pet rocks" feels revelatory about Baby Boomers. </p><h2 id="the-continuing-rise-of-brain-rot">The continuing rise of "brain rot"</h2><p>The above trends relate mostly to Generation Z. Generation A, people born between 2010 and 2024, are a different animal. That generation is defined by "brain rot," an online style that is nearly impossible to understand. Brain rot describes online content with no educational, social, or artistic value. It also describes the effects that continued viewing of this content is suspected to have on its audience. Brain rot content often involves references to other memes, which are often themselves based on other memes. The eventual result is expressions that are impossible to understand for anyone but their intended audience. </p><p>Here's how <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-cookie-king-brain-rot" target="_blank">Cookie King</a>, a pioneer of brain rot, described the inspiration for a video he posted: "On Instagram, there was a new meme. It was about Chopped Chin and Property in Egypt, and people were doing battles between them. I was like, 'Wait, what if I just combined them together with the Johnnie Walker thing and the Friggin' Packet Yo?" There has never been a better explanation presented. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>The Auto-Resistance on Peloton's Bike+ Might Make the Extra Cost Worth It</title>

            <description>Peloton's advanced at-home cycle, the Bike+, has a neat feature I liked
                more than I expected to.</description>
            <media:thumbnail

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>For two weeks, I've been testing out a Bike+, the upgraded version of Peloton's famous Bike, all so I can write reviews of it. Since I've been <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-review" target="_blank">an avid rider</a> of my regular Peloton Bike for four years, I've been <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/first-differences-i-noticed-after-upgrading-to-a-peloton-bike-plus" target="_blank">paying attention to any differences</a> I notice in the performance of the two stationary cycles&mdash;especially any differences that make their $1,000 price difference worthwhile. </p><p>The feature I was most excited to test out, which my Bike does not have, is auto-resistance. With that, the Bike+ automatically adjusts the rider's resistance for them, setting it within the boundaries of the resistance called for by a instructor at any given point during a virtual class. </p><h2 id="how-does-the-bikes-auto-resistance-work">How does the Bike+'s auto-resistance work?</h2><p>When you're taking an on-demand cycling class or completing a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-take-the-peloton-ftp-test" target="_blank">Power Zone workout</a>, the Bike+ will adjust your resistance so that you're somewhere in between the numbers the instructor is calling for. So, if your instructor says your resistance should be between 40 and 60, the auto-resistance feature will plop you somewhere in the middle of those values; you don't have to spin the resistance knob yourself. </p><p>The auto-resistance is pretty smart, in my experience. When I did a nighttime workout after a day full of teaching spin class, doing other Peloton rides, and walking around in the heat, I wasn't feeling particularly energetic or even athletic. The auto-resistance caught on to that and adjusted my resistance to the lower end of the spectrum the instructor was calling for. </p><p>Overall, it just makes taking a class a little easier because you don't need to be constantly reaching down to adjust the knob. You can focus only on your cadence (and form, breathing, output, and hydration, of course) without having to stay on top of your resistance, too. </p><h2 id="how-to-enable-or-disable-auto-resistance-on-the-bike">How to enable (or disable) auto-resistance on the Bike+</h2><p>Enabling and disabling auto-resistance can be done before or during a workout. When you select a workout to complete on your device's touchscreen, you'll see a pop-up window that outlines a few details like when the class first aired, who's teaching it, and what the class is called. You'll also see a button that says "Auto-Resistance [Off/On]," which will, obviously, signal to you that the feature is on or off before the class starts. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Once the class begins, you'll see a small lock icon next to the resistance on the lower right half of the screen. You can tap it to unlock it (turn auto-resistance off) or lock it (turn it on). I've noticed that if I start a workout with it off, then toggle it on, the auto-resistance tends to stick near whatever I was doing on my own. For instance, this morning, I started a class with it off, but was only riding about five above the lowest recommended resistance. When the instructor said resistance should be between 30 and 45, I was only doing 35. (I'm teaching classes later tonight, so I didn't feel I needed to over-exert myself! Leave me alone!) When I toggled auto-resistance on by tapping the lock icon, it consistently kept me at about five over the lowest recommended resistance level. </p><p>You can make manual adjustments while you ride, even if auto-resistance is turned on. At one point this morning, I did crank my resistance knob up to the highest recommended setting for a while. When the instructor told riders to lower their resistance a few minutes later, auto-resistance kicked in again and put me on a lower one with no issue, though it was, again, near the upper limits of the recommended range, since that's how I had set it manually. </p><h2 id="is-this-feature-worth-an-extra-1000">Is this feature worth an extra $1,000?</h2><p>The Peloton Bike+ is about $1,000 more than the regular Bike and will run you $2,495&mdash;with this auto-resistance feature being one of the main selling points. </p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<p>I did appreciate that the tech is smarter that I assumed it would be and was able to adjust my resistance not only to the middle of the recommended resistance range, but lower or higher within it, depending on how I am performing. I also appreciate that it can be manually overridden mid-class and even disabled completely if you're not into it. It's great to be able to ride without having to constantly think about making adjustments, plus I find it a little motivating. When I'm in charge of the resistance (like I have been for four years riding my Bike), I can slack a little if I want to, you know? Who's going to stop me if I choose to set my resistance to the absolute lowest recommended number? With auto-resistance, I feel just a little guilt if I consider manually overriding it to make my workout easier. More often than not, of course, I find that having my resistance set to the middle or higher end of the recommended spectrum is completely doable; I'm lazy, not incapable. The auto-resistance helps me stop being quite so lazy, which is a little counterintuitive, since the machine is doing the work of messing with the knob for me. </p><p>Still, If you don't mind reaching down and spinning that knob, if you don't think you'd find it particularly motivating to see your resistance set in the middle of the recommended range, or if you don't even think you'd use this feature, it may not be worth an extra grand. There are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/first-differences-i-noticed-after-upgrading-to-a-peloton-bike-plus" target="_blank">some other differences</a> between the two bikes that could push you over the edge and make you want to spend that extra dough, but don't forget that the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review" target="_blank">membership that allows you to take the classes</a> will cost you $44 per month forever, even after you've paid off the Bike, so that's another expense to consider.</p><p>Overall, I genuinely like this feature, but when I've disabled it or gone back to my trusty Bike after using it, I haven't really missed it. It's unique, cool, and useful, but it's not <em>necessary</em>. Coupled with the other improvements in the Bike+, however, it makes a strong case for an upgrade: The Bike+ has better speakers, a bigger screen, simpler adjustment knobs to change seat and screen height, and overall better performance while running Peloton's proprietary software. All of that combined with the extraordinarily efficient auto-resistance makes for a better machine. If you're looking to upgrade from your existing Bike to a Bike+, consider selling your older model on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-launches-resale-platform" target="_blank">Peloton's own resale site</a>, which will get you some cash <em>plus</em> a few hundred off your Bike+ purchase. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart glasses company <a href="https://solosglasses.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Solos</a> today announced two new entries in the wearable tech space: the AirGo A5 and AirGo V2. Solos says its mission is to "make wearable AI more intuitive, accessible, and integrated into daily life," so the idea behind these new spectacles is to ditch the gimmicks in favor of wearability and features people will actually use. </p><p>Here's a breakdown on what we can expect when these glasses hit the market later this year.</p><h2 id="solos-airgo-a5">Solos AirGo A5</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The AirGo A5 are audio-first, lightweight smart glasses designed for people who want everyday eyewear with intelligence and audio, but without the bulk or distraction of some wearables.</p><p>AirGo A5's cost less than industry leading Ray-Ban Metas, and are most notable for lacking a camera. This allows for lower weight, and also means your specs look more like normal glasses. The downside is obvious: no pictures.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the A5's features:</p><ul><li><p>Hands-free operation</p></li><li><p>Built-in SolosChat AI agent</p></li><li><p>Directional audio that minimizes sound leakage</p></li><li><p>Enhanced bass and high-quality audio</p></li><li><p>List price: starting at $249</p></li><li><p>Available Q3 2025</p></li></ul><p>There's something to be said for glasses that only do the things you want them to do instead of trying to do everything. I'm keenly interested in the audio quality and the comfort of these glasses. If they sound appreciably better than Ray Ban Metas, and they're comfortable enough to wear every day, they'd be a solid choice for a lot of smart glasses users. </p><p>If you'd like a camera, the AirGo V2 might be your style.</p><h2 id="solos-airgo-v2">Solos AirGo V2</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>V2 are camera-first smart glasses, aimed at "travelers, content creators, and anyone wanting to document and share life in the moment," according to Solos. Life-sharing is courtesy of an image-stabilized 16MP camera capable of shooting HD video. V2 also come equipped with SolosChat 3.0 AI, that uses ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. All that tech is contained Solos modular system that allows users to swap out frame fronts at will.</p><p> Here's a breakdown of the V2's features:</p><ul><li><p>16MP camera the company says is "the world&rsquo;s slimmest."</p></li><li><p>Electronic image stabilization </p></li><li><p>Low power wifi to save battery use</p></li><li><p>SolosChat 3.0 AI that can identify objects, translate signs, and get answers from multiple AI models.</p></li><li><p>Directional audio made to minimizes sound leakage</p></li><li><p>High-quality audio, featuring enhanced bass </p></li><li><p>Swappable battery</p></li><li><p>List price: starting at $299.</p></li><li><p>Available Q4 2025</p></li></ul><p>I'll be testing these smart glasses in real world conditions, as well as comparing them to the similarly priced Meta Ray Bans, in the near future, so check back for in-depth coverage. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Samsung Is Offering a Few Perks to Those Who Register to Pre-Order Its New

            <description>You can also get up to $1,150 toward a new phone when you trade in another
                device.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</p><p>Samsung has confirmed that its event, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/samsungs-next-galaxy-unpacked-will-be-all-about-an-ultra-foldable" target="_blank">Galaxy Unpacked July 2025</a><strong>, </strong>will take place on July 9. (An interesting choice to do it <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank">during Prime Day.</a>) The event will focus on its new foldable phones, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, both of which you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpvqp?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=pre-order%20now&amp;short_url=zjpvqp&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">pre-order now</a>.</p><p>People who pre-register and end up buying one of the phones will get a <strong>$50 credit</strong>, which you can use on accessories like cases or screen protectors on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAVGx?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Samsung.com&amp;short_url=QxAVGx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Samsung.com</a> or in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.ecomm&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Shop Samsung App</a>. </p><p>Samsung is also offering up to <strong>$1,150 </strong>in trade-in credits when you turn in a qualifying device through the Samsung Trade-In Program. You'll be able to then use that credit towards your purchase of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 or Z Flip 7.</p><p>Both of these deals are temporary, with no details on when they will end. Keep in mind that by putting your name down right now, you're not committing yourself to buying the phones; you're just placing a reservation to pre-order the phones later, so you can always back out. If you're sure you'll be buying one of these phones, it's better to put your name down rather than wait for the release. The process also automatically enters you into a $5,000 Samsung credit sweepstakes.</p><p>Samsung will then send you an email with information on how to redeem the deal during the pre-order window. There is no need to put any credit card information down when you sign up.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung also ends up offering a free upgrade to the next tier of storage (probably 512GB) along with the pre-order, once it's available. There will most likely be competing offers from Amazon and phone carriers, but again, you lose nothing by signing up for this one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of Windows 10 support is just a few months away, but Microsoft is giving users who can't (or don't want to) let go of Windows 10 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-extends-free-windows-10-security-updates-into-2026-with-strings-attached/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">more options to receive security updates</a> for an additional year. The company is cutting off most support for the older operating system on October 14, 2025, pushing users toward Windows 11. </p><p>One of the risks of <em>not</em> upgrading to Windows 11 by the deadline is that your device won't be protected against viruses and hackers&mdash;unless you take advantage of one of the free or paid options to enroll in Extended Security Updates (ESU). </p><p>Note that Microsoft has also <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/microsoft-will-now-support-office-apps-on-windows-10-until-2028" target="_blank">extended support for Microsoft 365 apps</a> on Windows 10 through October 10, 2028. </p><h2 id="how-to-get-windows-10-extended-security-updates">How to get Windows 10 Extended Security Updates</h2><p>Windows 10 users were already able to pay $30 for a year ESU coverage, which you can still do, but Microsoft is now offering <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">two additional options</a> to protect your device at no cost. You can either opt into Windows Backup to sync your settings to the cloud or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, which are accrued when you purchase or otherwise engage with Microsoft services, including Bing. Note that both of these "free" alternatives require you to have (or sign up for) a Microsoft account. </p><p>If you're still on Windows 10, you'll receive a push notification about the program, or you can find the enrollment wizard in your Settings app. Enrollment is already open in the Windows Insider Program, and Microsoft plans to roll it out for Windows 10 customers in July, with availability to all by mid-August. </p><p>The extended coverage will last until October 13, 2026, with critical security updates delivered on a monthly basis. Note that ESU does not include new features, non-security updates, design change requests, or tech support. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>All the Produce in Season in July (and the Best Ways to Use It)</title>

            <description>July is the best time to enjoy peak season produce raw, grilled, or even
                blended into ice cream.</description>
            <media:thumbnail

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>The days are long and the weather gives you a sense of what the inside of an air fryer must feel like. While June is full of hope, July is just sweaty&mdash;and we&rsquo;re closing in. The good news is that plants love the long sunny hours and gnarly humidity. Summer&rsquo;s produce will directly benefit as it ripens during this time&mdash;and so will you. This monthly article can help you decide which fruits and veggies to buy before they skyrocket in price, or completely disappear for another 10 months.</p><h2 id="why-seasonal-and-local-produce-beats-off-season">Why seasonal and local produce beats off-season</h2><p>Local produce is naturally going to be in season. Not only does buying local produce support regional farms situated somewhere closer to where you live but you&rsquo;re likely to benefit from a cheaper price tag. When all of the sweet corn gets harvested, and all of those New Jersey blueberries get picked, they won&rsquo;t last forever. Not just at the farmer&rsquo;s market either; big box stores like ShopRite will also have a glut of zucchini that they&rsquo;ll mark down significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You&rsquo;ll probably see a greater variety of tender greens and delicate fruits that don&rsquo;t travel out of state well too. And let&rsquo;s not forget about flavor: In-season produce is <em>robust</em>. If you&rsquo;ve ever had an imported, wintertime tomato and then tasted an in-season tomato from a local garden (maybe even your own), you know they almost taste like different fruits entirely.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="whats-in-season-right-now">What&rsquo;s in season right now</h2><p>My very favorite fruits are beginning to stroll into the grocery store: peaches. These along with other incredible stone fruits are what I wait for all year. Don&rsquo;t just buy <em>enough</em> fruit; buy &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; The excess is great for smoothies (here are a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-ascent-x5-blender-review" target="_blank"><u>couple great</u></a> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/vitamix-explorian-e310-blender-review" target="_blank"><u>blenders</u></a> that might interest you), and pies.</p><h3>The new produce ready for harvest in for July:</h3><ul><li><p>Apples</p></li><li><p>Blueberries</p></li><li><p>Raspberries</p></li><li><p>Peaches</p></li><li><p>Plums</p></li><li><p>Nectarines</p></li><li><p>Tart cherries</p></li><li><p>Collard greens</p></li><li><p>Snap beans (green beans)</p></li><li><p>Carrots</p></li><li><p>Cucumbers</p></li><li><p>Onions</p></li><li><p>Peppers</p></li><li><p>Potatoes</p></li><li><p>Tomatoes</p></li></ul><h3>Get &lsquo;em before they&rsquo;re gone:</h3><ul><li><p>Sweet Cherries</p></li><li><p>Garlic scapes</p></li><li><p>Green sweet peas</p></li><li><p>Rhubarb</p></li><li><p>Snap peas</p></li><li><p>Snow peas</p></li></ul><h3>Produce in peak season:</h3><ul><li><p>Beet greens</p></li><li><p>Apricots</p></li><li><p>Strawberries</p></li><li><p>Beets</p></li><li><p>Broccoli&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Cabbage&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Garlic</p></li><li><p>Mustard greens</p></li><li><p>Zucchini &amp; summer squash</p></li><li><p>Lettuce</p></li><li><p>Radishes and their greens</p></li><li><p>Spinach</p></li><li><p>Swiss chard</p></li></ul><p>Keep in mind that availability varies by a few weeks regionally&mdash;so don&rsquo;t be jealous if rhubarb left you a week ago, and don&rsquo;t get cocky if you started seeing plums at the farmer&rsquo;s market already.

<h2 id="what-to-cook-with-your-bounty">What to cook with your bounty</h2><h3>Fruits</h3><p>July is about the time we all start to hate turning on our ovens. It&rsquo;s OK to avoid pie baking if need be. Instead, use your summer fruit bounty in no-bake desserts and for goodness&rsquo; sake, eat the stuff raw. Add peaches and plums to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt. Make stovetop compotes, which are quick and easy. Or you can really avoid the heat and use the microwave. I use frozen berries in <a href="https://lifehacker.com/jazz-up-desserts-with-a-microwave-fruit-compote-1850127410" target="_blank"><u>this microwave compote</u></a> but you can use fresh fruit too. Don&rsquo;t count out the air fryer either. Roasting fruits, vegetables, and cooking small pies is quicker and the heat is less radiant than with the conventional oven. Here are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-air-fryers" target="_blank"><u>my favorite air fryers of 2025</u></a> so far.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, the best way to cool off is with a frozen treat. Mix fresh fruit or your newly made microwave compote into homemade ice cream, sorbet, or a slushy. I suggest a simple ice cream maker like this <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/cuisinart-pure-indulgence-ice-cream-maker-review" target="_blank"><u>Cuisinart Pure Indulgence</u></a>, or for a single serving, nothing beats the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/dash-my-mug-ice-cream-maker-review" target="_blank"><u>Dash My Mug</u></a>. If you really want to get fancy, use the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/ninja-slushi-review" target="_blank"><u>Ninja Slushi</u></a> for a frozen drink. Blend your fresh fruit into a puree before adding it into your drink mixture.</p><p>Speaking of refreshing drinks, you can also use frozen fruit to function as ice cubes for your summer cocktails. You can even use them to make an infused <a href="https://lifehacker.com/infuse-campari-with-frozen-berries-1844180467" target="_blank">shaken Campari cocktail</a>.</p><p>If you can get used to a little oven warmth, now&rsquo;s the time to churn out some pies. Cherry pies, peach pies, or blueberry tarts&mdash;whatever fruit you can get your hands on. Here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://lifehacker.com/easy-lattice-pie-crust-1848209585" target="_blank"><u>fail-proof way to lattice pie crust</u></a>, and my <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-make-the-best-fruit-pie-no-soggy-bottom" target="_blank"><u>best advice on preventing soggy fruit pies</u></a>. If you&rsquo;ve had trouble with pie in the past, give these a read.&nbsp;</p><h3>Vegetables&nbsp;</h3><p>Beans, carrots, cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes are all joining us for July. Sounds like a salad to me. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of raw salad (I understand), try <a href="https://lifehacker.com/use-leftover-rice-to-make-a-warm-comforting-salad-1850783678" target="_blank"><u>a warm salad</u></a> with some grains tossed in. Make a quick stir fry with the cabbage, peas, and greens. Now is also the best time to make a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/your-crudite-platter-is-boring-and-wrong-1849424444" target="_blank"><u>crudit&eacute; platter</u></a>. I know, it sounds boring, but raw produce never tastes better than when it&rsquo;s in peak season.&nbsp;</p><p>This goes for both fruits and veg: grill them. It almost couldn't be easier. Swipe a neutral cooking oil over planks of squash or halved peaches and pop them on the blisteringly hot grates for a minute just to get some color. Salt them when they come off the heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before you know it, we&rsquo;ll all be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/every-way-to-eat-a-tomato-before-the-season-is-over-1785479848" target="_blank"><u>swimming in tomatoes</u></a>. And during that time, we have a duty to eat as many as possible every day. Get a jar of mayo and sliced bread ready for when that time finally swings around.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>Why You Should Think Twice Before Using Buy Now, Pay Later With Apple Pay</title>

            <description>Apple discontinued their "buy now, pay later" program, but third party
                plans still work with Apple Pay.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you're checking out <a href="https://lifehacker.com/prime-day" target="_blank"><u>your Prime Day deals</u></a> in just a few weeks, one payment option you'll want to reconsider is "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/dont-use-buy-now-pay-later-for-prime-day-purchases" target="_blank"><u>buy now, pay later</u></a>" financing.</p><p>Last year Apple discontinued its own take on &ldquo;buy now, pay later&rdquo; (BNPL), <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120477" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple Pay Later</a>. The service may no longer be available in name, but BNPL purchases are readily available when you check out with Apple Pay. So, what exactly has changed about paying with installments via Apple Pay, and what sets it apart from other BNPL programs&mdash;for better or for worse? </p><h2 id="what-is-buy-now-pay-later">What is &ldquo;buy now, pay later?&rdquo;</h2><p>A &ldquo;buy now, pay later&rdquo; service is exactly what it sounds like: You can make a purchase immediately, and then pay for it through a series of installments over time. Although BNPL has some perks for breaking up a major expense, there are risks involved. Even if these loans have little-to-no interest, you are still taking on debt. And while BNPL plans don&rsquo;t directly impact users&rsquo; credit scores at the moment, that's set to change. Coming this fall, <a href="https://investors.fico.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fico-unveils-groundbreaking-credit-scores-incorporate-buy-now" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">FICO says</a> it will start including BNPL payment histories in how it calculates credit scores. If you're at risk of not getting your BNPL payments in according to schedule, you'll be putting your credit score at risk, too.</p><p>Any personal finance writer with a semblance of a conscience <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-to-know-before-using-buy-now-pay-later-financing-1844945584" target="_blank">will advise against</a> making a habit of using these services. They&rsquo;re helpful if you really need to finance something big, but whenever possible, it&rsquo;s best to avoid taking on debt for everyday expenses.</p><h2 id="how-can-you-pay-with-installments-using-apple-pay">How can you pay with installments using Apple Pay?</h2><p>The official "Apple Pay Later" is no more, but Apple Pay is still an omnipotent digital wallet with BNPL options. Major BNPL providers like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q476WA?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Affirm%2C&amp;short_url=Q476WA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Affirm,</a> <a href="https://zdcs.link/73PGG?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Afterpay%2C&amp;short_url=73PGG&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Afterpay,</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/NKL52?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Klarna&amp;short_url=NKL52&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Klarna</a> have partnered with Apple to offer their services directly through Apple Pay.</p><h3>How to set up BNPL with Apple Pay</h3><p>The setup process varies slightly depending on your BNPL provider:</p><p><strong>For Klarna:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Klarna app and create an account.</p></li><li><p>Complete the verification process.</p></li><li><p>In the Klarna app, look for the option to add to Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Follow the prompts to add your Klarna card to Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Affirm:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Create an Affirm account through their app or website.</p></li><li><p>Get pre-qualified for spending limits, up to $30,000.</p></li><li><p>Add the Affirm virtual card to your Apple Wallet.</p></li><li><p>Use it like any other payment method in Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p><strong>For Afterpay:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download the Afterpay app and set up your account.</p></li><li><p>Link a debit or credit card for your installment payments.</p></li><li><p>Afterpay should pop up directly at checkout when using Apple Pay.</p></li></ol><p>When you make a purchase using BNPL through Apple Pay, the total amount is automatically divided into your installment plan. Your first installment is typically charged immediately, while the BNPL company pays the merchant the full amount. All your subsequent installments are automatically charged to your linked payment method according to schedule.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-these-bnpl-programs">What are the risks of these BNPL programs?</h2><p>Naturally, Apple users may be drawn to the convenience of a BNPL options during Apple Pay checkout. However, that convenience might just be the biggest risk. They can make it all too easy to spend more than you can actually afford. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/MpLKL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Consumer%20Financial%20Protection%20Bureau%20released%20a%20report&amp;short_url=MpLKL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a report</a>&nbsp;that shows BNPL users were more likely to have higher credit card debt, delinquencies on other credit products, and lower credit scores than nonusers.</p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>If you are going to use any BNPL service, keep these tips in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Think about your current and future budget.</strong> When a bigger payment gets broken down into smaller installments, you might find yourself overspending in the long run because it "feels" like you can afford it. Stay on top of how much you&rsquo;re actually spending, and how it will impact your overall budget going forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stick to the essentials.</strong> BNPL should really only be used on completely necessary purchases that you can&rsquo;t afford upfront, but can afford in six weeks. </p></li><li><p><strong>Keep an eye on your account balance.</strong> Klarna, Affirm, or an BNPL service are not credit cards. Even if Apple doesn&rsquo;t charge fees for missed payments, your bank will still charge you overdraft fees. Plus, if you default on a BNPL loan, you&rsquo;re at risk of damaging your credit score.</p></li></ul><p>The most important thing is that you know what you're doing: Before you pay for anything with installments, be thoughtful about why you&rsquo;re taking on this debt in the first place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/fuck-wallets-1847565314" target="_blank">Why do I still carry a wallet</a>? My iPhone can handle just about anything you used to need a traditional wallet for. Most (if not all) of my purchases are made via Apple Pay or QR code, my phone holds all of my pictures, and most of my receipts go straight to my email. Basically the only I keep my wallet around is to carry my ID. Once my state starts supporting Apple&rsquo;s digital ID feature, however, things will change between me and my wallet&mdash;provided that support ever comes.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-your-iphone-as-an-official-id-1847597651" target="">Since iOS 15.4</a>, Apple has allowed you to add a driver&rsquo;s license or other state ID to your iPhone&rsquo;s digital wallet. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve been needlessly carrying your ID around since then&mdash;states have been slow to roll out their own support the feature, and most have yet to sign on at all. </p><p>When I first covered this feature in 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/07/iphone-wallet-ids-which-states/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">only two states actively allowed you to add your ID to your iPhone</a>, while 10 more (plus Puerto Rico) had confirmed plans to offer the option eventually, on a loose timeline of &ldquo;soon.&rdquo; Fast forward three years, and <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id#states-list" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">just 9 states and one territory now</a> officially allow you to add IDs to Wallet.</p><h2 id="these-states-support-digital-id-now">These states support digital ID now</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the full list as it stands in June 2025:</p><ul><li><p>Arizona</p></li><li><p>California</p></li><li><p>Colorado</p></li><li><p>Georgia</p></li><li><p>Hawaii</p></li><li><p>Iowa</p></li><li><p>Maryland</p></li><li><p>New Mexico</p></li><li><p>Ohio</p></li><li><p>Puerto Rico</p></li></ul><h2 id="support-is-still-coming-soon-in-these-states">Support is still "coming soon" in these states</h2><p>These states had originally pledged that support was "coming soon," but after nearly three years, still haven't committed:</p><ul><li><p>Connecticut</p></li><li><p>Kentucky</p></li><li><p>Mississippi</p></li><li><p>Oklahoma </p></li><li><p>Utah</p></li></ul><h2 id="airports-where-you-can-use-a-digital-id-in-apple-wallet">Airports where you can use a digital ID in Apple Wallet</h2><p>Now, be warned: You can't simply hand a cop your iPhone when you get pulled over. There are specific, limited use cases for this feature. Right now, that means identifying yourself at the airport, as well as at select businesses. Apple worked with the TSA to make this happen, and it currently works at the following airports:</p><ul><li><p>Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)</p></li><li><p>Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG)</p></li><li><p>Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)</p></li><li><p>Denver International Airport (DEN)</p></li><li><p>Des Moines International Airport (DSM)</p></li><li><p>Eastern Iowa Airport (CID)</p></li><li><p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)</p></li><li><p>John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH)</p></li><li><p>Los Angeles International (LAX)</p></li><li><p>Luis Mu&ntilde;oz Mar&iacute;n International Airport (SJU)</p></li><li><p>Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)</p></li><li><p>Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)</p></li><li><p>San Francisco International Airport (SFO)</p></li><li><p>San Jose Mineta International (SJC)</p></li></ul><p>This feature will also work with participating businesses to verify your age. That includes bars, restaurants, liquor stores, festivals, concerts, and certain age-restricted apps. That business will need to have age verification set up on their end, but if so, Apple says you can tap your iPhone against theirs to pull up your ID. Then, you can double-click your iPhone's side button to confirm you'd like to share your ID.  </p><h2 id="how-to-add-a-digital-id-to-your-iphone">How to add a digital ID to your iPhone</h2><p>If you do live in a supported state, setting up the feature is simple. Open Wallet, then, tap the (+) in the top right, then choose &ldquo;Driver&rsquo;s License and ID Cards.&rdquo; Choose your state, then choose whether to add the ID to your iPhone 8 or newer, as well as your Apple Watch Series 4 or newer. Either way, you&rsquo;ll need to scan your ID with your iPhone&rsquo;s camera, then scan your face to prove your identity. Once complete, send all information to your state to confirm. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The next time you fly from a participating airport, you can unlock your iPhone and place it next to the ID scanner. You&rsquo;ll see your digital ID appear, complete with all information you will be sharing with the TSA if you approve (name, date of birth, sex, ID number, state, issue and expiration dates, real ID status, and ID photo).</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Delivery services sometimes seem hell bent on not delivering your package
                despite your best efforts.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scenario is always the same: You're waiting anxiously for an important <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/free-amazon-package-brushing-scam" target="_blank">package</a>, which UPS or FedEx confidently tells you will arrive by &ldquo;end of day.&rdquo; You wait all day, watching for the package, only to discover that the delivery driver claims they tried to deliver the package, but no one was home.</p><h2 id="why-youre-getting-delivery-attempted-notices">Why you're getting  "delivery attempted" notices </h2><p>The logistics behind getting your Amazon package from a fulfillment center halfway around the country (or the world) to your door are incredibly complex, so it&rsquo;s not terribly surprising that there will be occasional hiccups. The &ldquo;attempted delivery&rdquo; sticker serves a vital function: It lets you know that your package is being handled, and gives a warning that you&rsquo;ll need to be home to receive it. Usually, you get a few delivery attempts before the package is returned to the shipper.</p><p>While it&rsquo;s rare that a driver would lie about trying to deliver your package, it&rsquo;s not impossible. Drivers have heavy schedules to adhere to, and falling behind usually isn&rsquo;t acceptable. Drivers typically have a bit of discretion when it comes to attempting deliveries&mdash;they can refuse to enter unsafe areas or properties, for example. And not all drivers care about the reputation of the parent company; while most drivers working for United Parcel Service (UPS) work directly for them, most of the drivers working for Fed Ex Ground are actually <a href="https://bakercityherald.com/2023/10/27/how-much-do-fedex-delivery-drivers-make/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">third-party hires</a>, which means they might be more motivated to keep up with their route schedule and get home than ensuring everyone gets their package as quickly as possible.</p><p>One of the most maddening things about missed &ldquo;attempted delivery&rdquo; notices is that you&rsquo;ll often get a photo of your house as proof that the driver was physically there. This is often necessary for the driver, as their location is tracked, so they can&rsquo;t simply claim to have been there. But as his person notes <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hurts_so_good/video/7488439950669794606" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">in their video</a>, these photos are often taken from the truck <em>as it drives by</em>, allowing the driver to save a minute or two while documenting a delivery &ldquo;attempt.&rdquo;</p><h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-keep-getting-delivery-attempted-notices">What to do if you keep getting "delivery attempted" notices</h2><p>There&rsquo;s no magic bullet for ensuring your package shows up as promised. But there are some steps you should take that can help:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sign up for <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-life-is-better-without-notifications-1849653045" target="_blank">alerts</a></strong><strong>. </strong>UPS, FedEx, and other shippers let you sign up for delivery updates via text, email, or app. This way, you&rsquo;ll get a notice that a delivery was attempted just a few seconds after the driver scans the package. That might enable you to rush outside to catch a driver who&rsquo;s simply confused, but it also means you can take action immediately.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complain.</strong> Contact the delivery company and lodge a complaint. Make sure you have all the details, like the tracking number and the date and time of the attempted delivery. Creating a record with customer service is an essential, if frustrating, step. Being able to do this immediately after the attempted delivery notice helps buttress your case, since you&rsquo;re clearly home, waiting for the package.</p></li><li><p><strong>Capture footage.</strong> Some consumers <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/fed-ex-we-missed-you-note/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">have reported</a> that submitting video that shows drivers going past their house at the time a delivery attempt was supposedly made has resulted in refunds and expedited delivery responses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Re-route.</strong> If your main priority is to get your hands on your package, you can usually contact the shipping company and have them re-route the package to a pickup location near you. This isn&rsquo;t as convenient as having it dropped at your door, but usually ensures you actually get it.</p></li></ul><p>Some frustrated folks have suggested that contacting customer service immediately after receiving an attempted delivery notice and claiming that the package is an urgent one can help, as these sorts of claims will usually be escalated to a supervisor automatically. That seems ethically sketchy, but might be effective if you&rsquo;re desperate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>Plus, Apple has "fixed" the Finder icon.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm pretty excited about macOS Tahoe. Apple's annual operating system upgrade is poised to introduce <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/coolest-barely-mentioned-features-macos-26-tahoe" target="_blank">a number of exciting new features and changes</a>, including <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/first-look-at-apples-new-liquid-glass-style-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">a fresh design</a> and an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-spotlight-search-does-macos-26-tahoe" target="_blank">upgraded Spotlight Search</a>. </p><p>Tahoe won't be available to the general public for a while, as the OS is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-macos-26-tahoe-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">still in beta testing</a> as Apple irons out the kinks. To that end, the company dropped the second beta for macOS Tahoe this week, and it includes three key features I'm particularly interested in.</p><h2 id="airpods-beta-enrollment">AirPods beta enrollment</h2><p>Speaking of beta testing, did you know that Apple has a beta program for AirPods? If you didn't, that's probably by design, since up until now, only developers could enroll their AirPods in the beta. </p><p>That's now changing: With Apple's latest releases this fall, users will be able to opt-in to the AirPods beta firmware updates, too. If you want to test out new features on your AirPods, at the risk of glitches or bugs, you can. </p><p>On macOS Tahoe beta 2, that option is present in the settings for your AirPods. If you open <strong>System Settings &gt; Bluetooth</strong>, then choose the <strong>(i)</strong>. Here, you'll see "AirPods Beta Updates," which contains the opt-in toggle. Once you enroll your AirPods, they'll install beta updates when in their charging case and within range of your Mac.</p><h2 id="the-finder-icon-has-been-fixed">The Finder icon has been "fixed"</h2><p>Apple's new "Liquid Glass" design has been met with both praise and criticism. But ignoring the love/hate glassy effect itself, one change, at least on macOS, was particularly controversial: the Finder icon. </p><p>While Apple's Finder icon has gone through numerous design changes over the years, the overall concept has remained largely the same: The left side of Finder's face is dark blue, while the right side is lighter. Apple literally flipped the script with the first beta of macOS Tahoe, by making the entire logo light, and the right side dark blue. What's more, the right side was reduced, so you could see the light background behind it. It's was a big change, design-wise, and many were <em>unhappy</em> about it.</p><p>Luckily, macOS Tahoe is in beta, which means anything can change before the final release. The Finder icon is one such case: With beta 2, Apple has restored Finder logo's original color scheme. As you can see below, the left side of the face, as well as the background as a whole, are dark blue, while the right side is back to light: </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/9to5mac/status/1937217065988845913" title="open in a new window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>Classic Finder fans will likely prefer this change, though Apple is still sticking with the smaller right face. While that may still be controversial to some, I think it fits the new Liquid Glass theme while retaining the icon's original appeal. Truthfully, I don't actually hate the original attempt from the first beta, and I wouldn't be opposed to Apple offering multiple versions of its icons in future releases that you can change up depending on your personal style. That said, if I had to choose one design right now, I'm going with this one from beta 2. </p><h2 id="you-can-bring-back-the-menu-bars-background">You can bring back the menu bar's background </h2><p>Another big design change for macOS Tahoe is the transparent menu bar. It's the first time Apple's menu bar icons will just float on top of your desktop, without a defined bar in place. It's a cool look, but as of beta 2, you don't need to live with it. </p><p>Apple has added a new "Show menu bar background" option in Settings, that brings back the menu bar's classic look. If you don't like the transparent look, or you find it difficult to differentiate between the menu bar and you desktop, this might be a good setting to change: </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

They just want as much of your money as possible, and so traditional shopping events like Black Friday see deals across the spectrum of brands and manufacturers. But Amazon is different. </p><h2 id="amazon-is-both-a-store-and-a-manufacturer">Amazon is both a store<em> and </em>a<em> </em>manufacturer </h2><p>While the company sells <em>tons </em>of products from a wide variety of manufacturers, it also makes its own tech. If you&rsquo;re looking for a new smart TV, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62RRk?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20makes%20one&amp;short_url=z62RRk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon makes one</a>; if you just want the smart TV streaming device, <a href="https://zdcs.link/3db03?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20makes%20that%20as%20well&amp;short_url=3db03&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon makes that as well</a>. For home security, there are both <a href="https://zdcs.link/joGYL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Blink&amp;short_url=joGYL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Blink</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDZ3B?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Ring%20products&amp;short_url=QKDZ3B&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Ring products</a>. Alexa powers so many of these devices, so why not get one of its <a href="https://zdcs.link/xP7nO?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=smart%20speakers&amp;short_url=xP7nO&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">smart speakers</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdVLq?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=screens&amp;short_url=GdVLq&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">screens</a> operated via the personal assistant? <a href="https://zdcs.link/71bPy?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20Basics&amp;short_url=71bPy&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Amazon Basics</a> even makes plenty of accessories, from USB cables to batteries. </p><p>Amazon now makes so much tech, it only makes sense that the company would prefer to sell you its version of a product over that of the competition. Instead of a Roku, buy a Fire TV stick. Instead of a Nest Mini, buy an Echo Pop. It seems Amazon has comparable products in almost every category&mdash;they even make their own earbuds (<a href="https://zdcs.link/2ebqD?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Echo%20Buds&amp;short_url=2ebqD&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Echo Buds</a>).</p><p>The quality of these products compared to the competition is certainly up for debate, and I encourage you to do your own research before buying any tech product&mdash;made by Amazon or otherwise. But whenever you do search for a tech product on Amazon, and especially during Prime Day, you&rsquo;re going to be served up an Amazon alternative. It&rsquo;s only in the company&rsquo;s best interest to use the event to run big deals on its own products.</p><p>Amazon is still a market, and it&rsquo;s good for them when you buy anything, so if you end up going with a Samsung TV over an Amazon TV, that&rsquo;s still a sale. That's why you&rsquo;ll still find plenty of deals throughout Prime Day for non-Amazon devices. But Amazon products will be pushed the hardest and likely see the biggest discounts and promotions.</p><h2 id="still-dont-impulse-buy">Still, don&rsquo;t impulse buy</h2><p>Eye-grabbing discounts and tempting product bundles aside, don&rsquo;t buy an Amazon device just because it looks like a killer deal. If you are in the market for a specific Amazon-made product and it goes on sale, great. That&rsquo;s a smart purchase. If you were more interested in a non-Amazon device but the Amazon version is now significantly cheaper, though, it&rsquo;s not necessarily worth chasing value over getting the product you actually want to buy.</p><p>Take the time to research the difference between Amazon&rsquo;s version and the competition. If you do find an Amazon device you want to buy, you can set alerts <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/how-to-set-your-own-prices-for-amazon-prime-day-and-wh-1849158967" target="_blank">to be notified when the product hits the price you're looking for</a>. That&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com/the-only-good-advice-for-shopping-amazon-prime-day-1849154608" target="_blank">good general advice for any Prime Day deal</a> (or any big-ticket purchase), but considering how hard Amazon will be pushing its own products in July, it&rsquo;s especially important to keep in mind. If you buy anything on Prime Day, I hope you get deals on the best devices <em>for you</em>, whether Amazon made them or not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix's July lineup includes <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> (July 25), a much-anticipated sequel with Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald reprising their roles as Happy and Shooter McGavin, respectively. The film, set 30 years after the original, sees Happy Gilmore's return to golf to pay for his daughter's ballet school. The list of cameos by pro golfers and other stars in sports and music is long. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video">

<p>Less comedy, more drama is <em>Untamed </em>(July 17), a limited mystery thriller series featuring Eric Bana as a special agent for the National Parks Service as he hunts for a killer in Yosemite National Park. Sam Neill also stars. </p><p>Netflix has a long list of documentaries premiering in July, including <em>Apocalypse in the Tropics</em> (July 14), which explores the role of evangelical Christianity on far-right politics in Brasil, including the rise of president Jair Bolsonaro. The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in August 2024 and was directed by Petra Costa, who also created the highly acclaimed <em>The Edge of Democracy</em>. </p><p>July also brings two new reality series:<em> All The Sharks</em> (July 4), is a six-episode competition in which four teams race to photograph the most sharks and shark habitats, while <em>Building The Band</em> (July 9) brings 50 singers together to form musical groups without ever seeing each other. </p><p>Netflix is also dropping five installments of <em>Trainwreck</em>, its anthology docu-series covering major news events gone wrong. This month's stories include the rise and fall of fashion brand American Apparel (<em>The Cult of American Apparel</em>, July 1), the viral 2008 Project X party (<em>The Real Project X</em>, July 8), the 2009 balloon boy hoax (<em>Balloon Boy</em>, July 15), the P.I. moms scandal (<em>P.I. Moms</em>, July 22), and the viral storming of Nevada's Area 51 (<em>Storm Area 51</em>, July 29). </p><p>On the sports side, docu-series <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> (July 2) and <em>Quarterback </em>(July 8) return, alongside the new <em>WWE: Unreal </em>(July 29)&mdash;WWE Raw and other WWE content is now exclusive to Netflix. The platform will also host a live boxing match between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano on July 11, streaming from Madison Square Garden. </p><p>Here's everything coming to Netflix in July, and everything that's leaving.</p><h2 id="whats-coming-to-netflix-in-july-2025">What's coming to Netflix in July 2025</h2><h3>Available July 1</h3><ul><li><p><a

            <title>Eight Issues to Negotiate With Your New Neighbors As Soon As You Move In</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us get along just fine with our neighbors&mdash;sometimes we even become friends. But even if you&rsquo;re friendly with the people on your block, in your cul de sac, or across the hall, you can still run into <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-peacefully-resolve-a-dispute-with-your-neighbor-1850517835" target="_blank">disputes</a> with them, and those disputes can turn ugly.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to do some negotiating the moment you move into your new place. By addressing potential issues right away, you can avoid any future awkwardness. </p><h2 id="parking">Parking</h2><p>Iif you&rsquo;re like most people in this country, you rely on your vehicle to get to and from work, to buy groceries&mdash;to do almost anything outside of your immediate area.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re going to be relying on street parking, the time to address that need is immediately. Find out how much parking is generally available, and how people approach disputes over sloppy parking that eliminates valuable spaces, "saving" spots with chairs or other items, and those neighbors who seem to think the spot in front of their house is somehow theirs by right. Once you know the traditions and the existing treaties that neighbors have negotiated around parking, you can broach any special needs you might have, like a large truck that&rsquo;s going to eat up extra space, or a family member who needs easy access to the vehicle due to mobility issues.</p><p>If your new home comes with a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/stop-jerks-from-blocking-your-driveway" target="_blank">driveway</a>, you might think you&rsquo;re in the clear&mdash;until a neighbor parks in your driveway because they assume you only need to access it at certain times, or just because it suits them. Bringing up the subject and noting that you need the driveway clear at all times can prevent that moment when you want to drive somewhere but first have to hunt down a neighbor to get their car moved. </p><h2 id="sleep-schedules">Sleep schedules</h2><p>Not everyone <a href="https://lifehacker.com/create-perfect-sleep-routine" target="_blank">sleeps</a> on the same&mdash;or even compatible&mdash;schedules. If you work night shifts, or have a routine that includes very early mornings or very late nights, it&rsquo;s a good idea to let your neighbors know as soon as possible. A little warning that&mdash;despite your best efforts&mdash;you might make some noise in the wee hours when you go to work, or that you sleep during the day and would appreciate some peace and quiet, can lead to a healthy conversation and an arrangement that avoids future arguments.</p><h2 id="fencing-and-trespassing">Fencing and trespassing</h2><p>Whether it&rsquo;s the maintenance of a shared <a href="https://lifehacker.com/10-cheap-ways-to-fence-in-your-yard-1849354922" target="_blank">fence</a>, a garden that creeps over the official property line, or tree branches that overhang your roof, it&rsquo;s a good idea to note potential boundary issues as soon as you move in. If nothing else, you&rsquo;ll know right away whether your neighbor is going to be reasonable about these issues or if you need to prepare for battle. And if you plan to have any work done to the property that might require an easement or access to your neighbor&rsquo;s property&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t plan to start work for a long time&mdash;negotiating that access as a general principle can save you trouble when the time comes.</p><p>Another boundary issue that&rsquo;s worth raising: trespassing. The word sounds dire, but any time someone traverses your property without explicit permission, it&rsquo;s trespassing. That includes the neighbor who finds it easier to cut through your yard than to go around, the neighbor&rsquo;s kids who use your yard as an extension of theirs, or the "helpful" guy who <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/helpful-things-you-actually-shouldnt-do-for-your-neighbor" target="_blank">mows your lawn</a> the way he likes it. It&rsquo;s your property, and you have every right to allow folks to use it&mdash;or not. And the same goes for your neighbor. Having a conversation about what you&rsquo;re both comfortable with is a great way to keep the peace for as long as you live there.</p><h2 id="pets">Pets</h2><p>Pets bring a lot of joy to people&rsquo;s lives, but they can be terrible neighbors&mdash;they live their lives blissfully ignorant of property law and the rules of polite society. So if you&rsquo;re bringing a pet into the neighborhood or moving into a spot heavily populated by animal companions, negotiating what&rsquo;s okay and what&rsquo;s not okay is a must.</p><p>This can also include letting your neighbors know important things about your pets. For example, if you have an inside-only cat, you can ask your neighbor to always let you know if they see it outdoors. Or if your <a href="https://lifehacker.com/these-are-the-boundaries-every-dog-owner-should-teach-1846785580" target="_blank">dog</a> has anxiety around strangers, you can warn them not to let their kids get too close.</p><h2 id="shared-walls">Shared walls</h2><p>If you share walls with your neighbors, you might want to go beyond a casual negotiation on moving day and suggest a more formal <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/you-need-party-wall-agreement-with-neighbors" target="_blank">party wall agreement</a>. Shared walls can be problematic&mdash;damage affects both parties, maintenance should be shared, and what you do on your side of the wall will almost certainly be audible on the other side.</p><h2 id="outdoor-lights">Outdoor lights</h2><p>Outdoor lights in a yard or on a balcony or deck can be delightful&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s three in the morning and the lights are aimed directly into your bedroom window. Neighbors don&rsquo;t always think about the fact that outdoor lights are often left on all the time, especially now that so many are solar-powered. Asking your neighbors about the placement and operation of <em>your </em><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/i-tested-all-the-permanent-outdoor-lights-and-heres-what-id-buy" target="_blank">outdoor lights</a> offers the chance to then politely request that your neighbors put their lights on a timer, or orient them so they&rsquo;re not aimed directly at your house.</p><h2 id="security-cameras">Security cameras</h2><p>Security cameras can help you feel safe in your new home&mdash;but the best time to negotiate privacy issues with your neighbors is right away. You don&rsquo;t want to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-a-security-camera-without-breaking-the-l-1848006254" target="_blank">break any laws</a> when setting up your cameras, of course, and you also have no interest in making your neighbors feel like they&rsquo;re being watched. But not everyone thinks carefully about how they arrange security cameras, so it&rsquo;s worth checking out how your neighbors have handled this so you can politely ask for adjustments. Working together to negotiate what is and isn&rsquo;t on camera will enhance your security&mdash;because you&rsquo;ll have built trust and shared interests with your neighbors&mdash;and avoid awkward moments.</p><h2 id="renovations">Renovations</h2><p>If you bought your new place with the intention of doing a gut renovation, you know you&rsquo;ll be the most hated person in your neighborhood pretty much the moment the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/prevent-damage-during-home-renovations" target="_blank">chaos begins</a>. Anticipating and negotiating aspects of the renovation is a very good idea. If your neighbors understand the scope of the project, they&rsquo;ll be much less likely to complain and throw up roadblocks. Some aspects of a renovation that you should discuss ahead of time include:</p><ul><li><p>Contractor parking needs (especially if they&rsquo;re going to be eating up multiple spaces, or blocking roads and driveways)</p></li><li><p>Noise and schedules&mdash;your neighbors may have important events coming up, like work meetings or interviews, that would benefit from a break in the endless hammering and sawing</p></li><li><p>Property access, especially if there are areas of your property that can only be accessed via a neighbor&rsquo;s property</p></li></ul><p>You should also ask your neighbors if they have specific concerns. For example, if you&rsquo;re going to be tearing up your yard, a neighbor might worry about their trees or plantings being affected. Negotiating how you&rsquo;ll safeguard those areas ahead of time will make everything go a lot more smoothly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>My Four Favorite Android 16 Features That Haven't Launched Yet</title>

            <description>This sure is a slow rollout.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Google announced <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/android-16-is-now-available" target="_blank">the launch of Android 16</a>, available first on Pixel devices. If you've got a Pixel 6 or a Pixel 6 Pro (launched in 2021) or a later device, you should already have the software update.</p><p>What you won't have, however, are many of the new features that Google has been promoting with this Android upgrade&mdash;an upgrade that feels like a placeholder for what's coming later in the year. If you're rebooting your phone after installing Android 16 and looking around to see what's new, you might be disappointed.</p><p>There are a couple of bits of relevant context: First, Android 16 was launched much earlier in the year (June) than Android 15 (October), most probably to get well ahead of the Google Pixel 10 launch. It looks as though most of the major Android 16 updates will arrive around September or October.</p><p>Second, these major Android releases are, now more than ever, mainly for Pixel phones. Every Android phone maker puts its own spin on the Android code Google provides, and may not support every feature&mdash;or add extra features Google hasn't got around to. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/everything-new-in-samsungs-one-ui-8" target="_blank">Samsung's One UI 8</a>, based on Android 16, is the best example.</p><p>Further adding to the confusion are the additional Pixel Drops that Google regularly pushes out for its own phones and tablets. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-features-coming-in-the-june-2025-pixel-drop" target="_blank">The most recent one arrived</a> at the same time as Android 16, and brought with it features <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/pixel-now-lets-you-choose-vip-contacts-to-bypass-do-not-disturb" target="_blank">such as Pixel VIPs</a>, for giving selected contacts a higher priority on your device.</p><p>So, while Android 16 doesn't bring much that's new to my Pixel phone right now, there's plenty still on the way: Here are four key upgrades I'm looking forward to.</p><h2 id="material-3-expressive">Material 3 Expressive</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Google <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-announced-new-android-16-design" target="_blank">has already told us</a> about the big design revamp that's coming to Android 16, throwing around phrases like "emotional impact" and "more engaging" and "makes you feel something"&mdash;which in reality means more color, more curves, and screens that don't look quite as spartan as they do in Android 15.</p><p>From the screenshots Google has shared, it looks good, but I haven't even seen it appear in Google's own apps or the Android settings menus yet (that's due in September, as per an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/when-material-3-expressive-desktop-mode-roll-out-3565381/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Android Authority</a> source). After that, third-party developers will push their own updates out, so it's going to take a while for everything to be Material 3 Expressive-ized.</p><h2 id="live-updates">Live Updates</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>Android can already show real time information like timers and Uber estimates in persistent notifications, but Live Updates on Android 16 will make these notifications much more prominent, detailed, and interactive&mdash;a lot <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-iphone-apps-that-use-live-activities" target="_blank">like Live Activities on iOS</a>. Samsung is already ahead on this, with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-new-features-in-samsung-one-ui-7" target="_blank">the Now Bar</a> available in One UI 7.</p><p>However, I haven't seen a single app take advantage of Live Updates so far. It seems Android 16 is only laying the groundwork for the feature, and it's now over to app developers to get it implemented&mdash;something I expect will happen gradually over the coming months.</p><h2 id="a-full-desktop-mode">A full desktop mode</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Android 16 is much more capable on bigger screens, with better management of window resizing and grouping, so it's more desktop-like. This is an upgrade that is actually live now, but only for Android tablets&mdash;you're not going to be able to use it yet on an external monitor connected to your Pixel phone.</p><p>We know from the Android 16 betas and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-biggest-features-and-news-from-google-i-o-2025" target="_blank">Google I/O 2025</a> that the phone functionality support is on the way&mdash;so you'll be able to use your phone in desktop mode when connected to a monitor&mdash;but it's not here yet.

<p>The final announced-but-not-yet-live Android 16 feature is notification stacking, or "forced notification auto-grouping," as <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_us/new-features-on-android/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">it's officially described</a>. "Your notifications will automatically be grouped together to keep things looking tight and organized," says Google in the Android 16 announcement <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-16/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">blog post</a>.</p><p>Here, too, I'm still waiting. Android actually already does a decent job of grouping together notifications from the same app, so I'm not exactly sure what's going to be different, but based from the limited number of screenshots that have been shared, it looks as though the grouping will be more compact and easier to manage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>I predict that 2025 will be the year smart glasses break big. </p><p>The technology is finally advanced enough for tech spectacles to be useful instead of gimmicky; the general public knows what they are; and the new generation of smart glasses look like <em>glasses</em> instead of face computers. We've come a long way since Google Glass. </p><p>The big tech companies clearly agree, because everyone&rsquo;s making them: Meta wants to whisper AI in your ear. Google and Snap are joining the fray. Rumors are flying that Samsung and Apple are developing smart glasses. With so many styles, features, and price points hitting the market, it can be overwhelming to figure out what kind of glasses are right for you. Luckily, you don't have to be a tech expert to make a smart choice.</p><h2 id="what-smart-glasses-can-do">What smart glasses can do </h2><p>The term &ldquo;smart glasses&rdquo; is a little too broad to be useful. It's used for everything from AI-powered sunglasses to augmented reality displays to glasses that help you see better, so before you buy, it&rsquo;s worth asking: What exactly do you want your smart glasses to <em>do</em>?</p><p>Roughly speaking, smart glasses exist across these categories, although most straddle a few classifications:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Audio-first</strong>: These are basically earbuds embedded in glasses. They usually look like "normal" glasses, and they're designed to play music, take calls, and often to let you talk to an AI assistant. They don&rsquo;t have screens or AR overlays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Camera-first</strong>: These are like a lighter GoPro. They're for people who want to capture life on the fly, either through still images or videos. Some support live-streaming. </p></li><li><p><strong>AR-first</strong>: Glasses designed for AR (augmented reality) display digital information like directions, messages, video or even 3D animations directly in your field of view. </p></li><li><p><strong>Vision-first:</strong> These are the most future-looking smart glasses. Their purpose isn't to let you listen to podcasts, but to improve your vision. There aren't any vision-first smart glasses on the market in the U.S., but the future could hold cyborg-style vision improvements like automatic zoom, or automatically adjusting bifocals.  </p></li></ul><p>So those are the basics. Here's the gear:</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-hstn">Oakley Meta HSTN</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>XReal's One Pro smart glasses augment your reality so you can do things like watch a movie from inside your eyeglasses or answer your email on a virtual screen. I was generally impressed with the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/xreal-air-2-pro-ar-glasses-cool-but-frustrating" target="_blank">Xreal Pro line of glasses</a>, and the company's just-released One Pro glasses seem even better. Improvements include an onboard "Self-Developed Spatial Computing Chip," so there's no need for a separate Android device for them to work, and a wider field-of-view for better AR. Xreal Pro One glasses retail for $649.00 and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwDL0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=are%20available%20now&amp;short_url=QqwDL0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">are available now</a>. </p><h2 id="viture-pro-xr-glasses">Viture Pro XR Glasses</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Designed more for viewing pictures and video than hardcore AR or VR, Viture Pro XR Glasses work as a display for your PC, iPhone or Android device, Steam Deck, Switch 2, and more. The Pro XR displays the equivalent of a 135-inch screen at a distance of 9.8 feet at 1080p. The images are clear and bright, and it's all packed inside a cool-looking pair of shades.

<p><a href="https://www.spectacles.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Snapchat's smart glasses</a> have come a <em>long</em> way since the first line was released in 2016. Instead of a simple glasses-mounted camera, Snap Specs are a full, standalone AR unit packed in a pair of (clunky-looking) glasses. They come with AI, and allow you to do things like play AR games, share 3D space with others, and project an OS on the palm of your hand. I tried them out briefly at the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-vr-gear-and-games-from-augmented-world-expo-2025" target="_blank">Augmented World Expo 2025</a> and they're impressive and easy to use; I can't wait to get a pair. Snap Specs are planned for a 2026 release. No price has been announced.  </p><h2 id="chamelo-aura">Chamelo Aura</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I'm not sure Chamelo's Aura sunglasses even count as "smart glasses," but they're so cool, I had to include them. They don't have AI, a camera, speakers, or an in-lens display, but the lenses change between four colors instantly with a click, so you can choose the best tint for light conditions, coordinate your outfits, and impress your friends with your slick glasses. Aura sunglasses retail for <a href="https://chamelo.com/products/aura-prismatic-smart-glasses-electrochromic-color-changing-sunglasses" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">$365 and are available now</a>. </p><h2 id="google-android-xr-glasses">Google Android XR Glasses</h2><p>Thankfully, Google seems to have put the Google Glass fiasco behind it and is planning to release a pair of Android-powered smart glasses with a camera, Gemini AI support, and an optional see-through micro-display that will let you project info&mdash;messages, navigation, and real-time translation&mdash;right onto your lenses. Plus, Google has partnered with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster so they won't look dorky. Google Android XR Glasses are expected to be available in 2025-2026. </p><h2 id="samsungs-project-haean">Samsung's Project HAEAN</h2><p>Samsung&rsquo;s upcoming smart glasses are still under wraps, but the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-developing-coast-and-pearl-xr-smart-glasses/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">rumors out there</a> are intriguing. Unlike Samsung project Moohan experiment, HAEAN (if real) isn't a big VR helmet. It's a pair of glasses you could wear in public and not feel like a goof. They&rsquo;re rumored to be powered by Samsung&rsquo;s in-house XR chip and integrated with Galaxy AI, presumably with the end-goal of a voice and AI-centric wearable with a focus on comfort and wearability. </p><h2 id="apple-glass">Apple Glass</h2><p>Nothing has been announced officially, but the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673030/apple-ai-smart-glasses-2026-launch-rumor?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"> tech rumor mill </a>is churning with Apple's supposed plan to release a line of smart glasses. If what's been reported in various sources is true, Apple Glass will be like Meta's smart glasses, but better.  Maybe better just because they say "Apple" on them, but maybe actually <em>better</em>. If these actually exist, the rumor is they'll come out in 2026. </p><h2 id="ixi-autofocus-smart-glasses">IXI Autofocus Smart Glasses</h2><p>It's too early to tell whether this Finnish start-up's claims will turn into vapor, but <a href="https://ixieyewear.com/story" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">IXI</a> has recently raised $36.5 million from investors to develop smart glasses that invisibly and automatically adjust to correct farsightedness instead of playing podcasts or whatever. Lenses that automatically adjusted for optimum focus would be a <em>big</em> deal, because the step is glasses that <em>improve</em> on 20/20 eyesight, maybe by allowing long-distance views, or instant microscope eyes. No release date on this, but "a long way out" seems logical. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Once you've installed iOS 26, pinning your favorite Apple Music content is quite easy. You can pin one song, an album, or a playlist. As long as the music is added to your Apple Music library, you should be able to pin it. Just tap and hold the song, album, or playlist and select the <strong>Pin</strong> button to pin it.

<p>Apple lets you pin a maximum of six items at a time, and once you hit that limit, you'll have to remove a pinned item to add another. Removing a pin is also quite straightforward. Go to the <strong>Library</strong> tab in Apple Music, long press the pinned item you want to remove, and tap <strong>Unpin</strong> to remove the pinned item. You can always pin it later if you want to.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="customize-what-happens-when-you-tap-a-pinned-item-in-apple-music">Customize what happens when you tap a pinned item in Apple Music</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can choose what happens when you tap a pinned item in Apple Music in iOS 26. The default setting opens albums and playlists, but doesn't play them. Even if you pin a song and tap it, the default is to show you the album that the song is from, but not to play it. You can change this by long pressing the pinned item, selecting <strong>Tap Action</strong>, and choosing either <strong>Play</strong> or <strong>Shuffle</strong>. This way, when you tap the pinned item, Apple Music will play it immediately.</p><p>Note that the Tap Action is different for each pinned item. You'll have to manually set it up for each item in your pinned list. </p><h2 id="choose-if-you-want-to-automatically-download-pinned-songs">Choose if you want to automatically download pinned songs</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

And there's a good amount of juice to squeeze there. The price you pay for Amazon <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/what-does-amazon-prime-cost" target="_blank">depends on many factors</a>, but regardless of how much you're paying, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/is-amazon-prime-worth-it" target="_blank">it's worth it for most people</a> (we did the math). If you're on the fence about signing up, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank">Prime Day</a>, Amazon's biggest sale of the year, is just around the corner.

            <description>How do Meta's flagship smart glasses stack up after half a year?</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>Meta recently announced it's releasing a line of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/meta-ai-oakley-smart-glasses-announced" target="_blank">AI-powered Oakley sunglasses</a> to be sold alongside Ray-Ban Metas. According to the company, the new smart glasses have the same basic functions as the old, but the Oakleys have a higher resolution camera (3K vs. 1080p) and a battery that lasts twice as long as the Ray-Bans. </p><p>Seven months ago, I reviewed the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/review-ray-ban-meta-glasses" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>. These specs pack a camera, open-ear speakers, microphones, and voice-activated <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-turn-off-meta-ai-on-facebook-instagram-messenger-whatsapp" target="_blank">Meta AI</a> inside a pair of Wayfarer-style frames, so they're basically science-fiction glasses that look normal. I liked them so much, I had prescription lenses put in and made them part of my daily load out. But it's easy to love a tech product when it&rsquo;s new and shiny; the real test is how the Ray-Ban Metas fair after they've gone from novelty to another damn thing I have to remember to charge. Bottom line: I still really like them after over half a year of wearing them while working, sitting around, biking, running errands, and generally living my boring life. But I like them in a more nuanced way.</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h2 id="not-quite-everyday-glasses">Not quite everyday glasses</h2><p>After the initial sugar rush wore off, I started noticing the weight of the Ray-Ban Metas. They're around 49 grams out of the box, fairly heavy for sunglasses, but prescription lenses bumped the weight up to 54 grams. My regular specs are pretty chunky and weigh 39 grams, and the difference is noticeable. They're slightly uncomfortable for extended use. I found myself wearing regular glasses when I didn&rsquo;t expect to use smart features, and going back to the Ray-Bans if I wanted to take photos, record video, or go hands-free. The main downside was forgetting which pair I was wearing and saying &ldquo;Hey Meta&rdquo; to my dumb glasses. (But that&rsquo;s a me problem.)</p><h2 id="build-quality-durability-and-style-no-complaints">Build quality, durability, and style: no complaints</h2><p>I have to commend Ray-Ban, Meta, and whatever factory physically built these glasses, because they held up flawlessly. The tech works just as well now as it did when I got them, and the frames themselves held up, too: no warping, bent arms, or other malfunctions. (I didn't necessarily baby them or take special care of them.) They didn't go out of style in the last six months either, seeing as the Wayfarer design is timeless. If they&rsquo;re good enough for James Dean, they&rsquo;re good enough for me.</p><h2 id="battery-life-could-be-better">Battery life could be better</h2><p>Meta says their smart glasses have a battery life of "up to four hours," which is mildly optimistic&mdash;these things need to be charged often. The solution of having a charger built into the glasses' case is acceptable most of the time because the main function of eyeglasses (ensuring I can see things) works even when the batteries run out. But longer outings where I wanted to take lots of photos or videos were a pain. Your choices are to only have pictures of the first half of the graduation ceremony, or pack a back-up pair of glasses so you can charge on the fly. </p><p>Another battery related annoyance: You can&rsquo;t disable the low battery notification without disabling all notifications. While that's the case for many tech products, it would be great to have the option to disable it for these glasses.</p><h2 id="the-social-factor-being-seen-isnt-always-the-best">The social factor: Being seen isn't always the best</h2><p>When I first started wearing the Ray-Ban Metas daily, they pretty much flew under people's radars, but as popular awareness of the product grew, so did the people who noticed I was wearing them. More than one person asked &ldquo;are you taking pictures of me?" and I didn&rsquo;t love having my glasses spark conversations about surveillance or Meta&rsquo;s motives, but I get why some people are wary. They blur the line between fashion and tech in a way that&rsquo;s still new, and many people find them off-putting.</p><h2 id="ray-bans-many-features-ranked-and-rated">Ray-Ban's many features, ranked and rated</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a ton of features, and they're not equally useful, so here's a quick feature list, organized from the ones I used most to ones I used least:</p><p><strong>The camera: </strong>Ray-Ban Metas' essential feature for me is the camera. It's weird to think of a smart phone camera as being inconvenient, but reaching in your pocket, unlocking the screen, clicking an app, and putting it up to your face is a lot of steps compared to pinching the arm of your glasses. The other way to turn on the camera, saying &ldquo;Hey Meta, take a picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey Meta, take video," can be incredibly useful too, as it lets you take videos while riding a bike and listening to Hawkwind, like so: </p><blockquote class="tiktokEmbed tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7501573873637330218" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>
<p>While I found the quality of the photos to be surprisingly good, these glasses are best for casual snaps. There's no viewfinder, and if you're going for super high quality, or want to shoot in low-light situations, they won't replace a "real" camera. </p><p><strong>Text and calls:</strong> Getting a text and replying by voice is great when your hands are full. Initiating or responding to texts while driving is amazing and will probably save some people's lives. Call quality is solid, and the voice recognition is excellent, even in traffic or crowds. It's easy to use too, since you can just say "Hey Meta, how do I send a text?" if you forget.</p><p><strong>Music</strong>: Halfway down the list is the perfect time to talk about the Ray-Ban Meta's music and audio. It is mid. The sound quality isn&rsquo;t terrible, but it's podcast-while-cooking level. If you&rsquo;re into music at all, you&rsquo;ll quickly grow tired of the tinny sounds from the Ray-Ban meta glasses and throw in some ear buds. On the plus side, the ability to control Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music with just your voice is great. Saying &ldquo;Hey Meta, play some funk&rdquo; and having The Meters start playing is cool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Language translation: </strong>Meta recently rolled out the ability to translate from Spanish, French, and Italian to English, and vice-versa. My initial reaction to testing it out with a Spanish speaking pal was "santa mierda!"<em> </em>It's <em>really</em> good, and was able to translate spoken words at a conversational rate in real time, with a surprisingly amount of accuracy. I listened to a graduations speech delivered in Spanish, and it translated it perfectly, and I tried it with some Telenovelas on YouTube too. Flawless. Language translation might prove to be smart glasses' killer app. </p><p><strong>Meta AI</strong>: Depending on your point of view, Meta&rsquo;s AI is the either the killer app or the Trojan horse of these glasses, but I almost never use it. When I first got the glasses, I was blown away by saying &ldquo;Hey Meta, look&rdquo; and having it describe what I was seeing accurately. But that wears off after eight minutes. Then, I started using it to clown on my friends by looking at their car or something and saying, &ldquo;Hey, Meta, is this a nice car?&rdquo;&nbsp;and relaying the answer. (Sadly, it won't roast <em>people</em>.) That was fun for three minutes. Then, I changed <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/meta-ray-bans-celebrity-voices-rated-from-least-to-most-annoying" target="_blank">Meta's voice to Awkwafina</a>. That was fun for 38 seconds. Then, I stopped using it altogether. Maybe your life is different, but mine is fine without an AI assistant. </p><h2 id="what-id-like-to-see-from-ray-ban-meta-glasses">What I'd like to see from Ray-Ban Meta glasses</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>These glasses are creeping toward being a true digital assistant, but they're not there. I want to say &ldquo;Hey, Meta, book me a cheap hotel in Yonkers next weekend&rdquo; and have it <em>just</em> <em>happen</em>. Right now, though, the glasses are limited to controlling music, sending messages, translating language in real time, and providing basic information&mdash;which is a lot for a pair of glasses.</p><h2 id="privacy-concerns-as-if-privacy-still-exists">Privacy concerns (as if privacy still exists)</h2><p>Meta recently sent an email to Ray-Ban Meta users that said, in part, "Meta AI with camera use is always enabled on your glasses unless you turn off &lsquo;Hey Meta,'&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;the option to disable voice recordings storage is no longer available.&rdquo; Basically, Meta is vowing to look at what I'm looking at and store whatever I say, so you could argue there are some pretty big<em> </em>privacy concerns. It&rsquo;s not great, but honestly, I&rsquo;m too boring to care. If Meta wants hours of footage of me folding laundry or playing <em>Oblivion Remastered,</em> that&rsquo;s their problem.</p><p>If you're someone that does prioritize your privacy though, these glasses are probably not the product for you. </p><h2 id="are-they-worth-the-price">Are they worth the price?</h2><p>Whether something is "worth it" really depends on the customer. But $299 seems like a good deal for a camera, AI agent, Bluetooth headset, and sunglasses, and if you're going for prescription Ray-Ban Metas, it's amazing. All told, these were actually cheaper than my regular glasses, and I can't ask my regular glasses to tell me a joke. </p><h2 id="is-it-a-good-time-to-buy-ray-ban-meta-glasses">Is it a good time to buy Ray Ban Meta glasses?</h2><p>Last week, I would have said, "Yes, it's a great time to buy Ray Bans!" but the announcement of the Meta Oakleys changes my calculations. The newer specs will retail for $399 or $499, where Meta Ray Bans list for $299 or $379&mdash;but the Oakleys will have a significantly better camera than the Ray Bans and double the battery life. If you already own a pair of Ray Ban Metas, I don't think it's worth it to buy Oakleys&mdash;it'd be nice to have more battery life and a better camera, but it's not vital. If you're buying a new pair of smart glasses, I'd pre-order the Oakleys for sure.</p><p>Meta hasn't said whether or when it plans to release a pair of Ray Ban Meta glasses with the same specs as the Oakleys, so it's probably not the best time to buy a new pair: There's little worse than buying a tech product the day before a newer, better version is announced.  </p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>I&rsquo;m not a Meta fanboy by any stretch, but credit where it&rsquo;s due: These glasses are <em>really good</em>. The novelty wears off, but the usefulness doesn&rsquo;t. Unlike most gadgets, they've earned their spot in my semi-daily rotation. If they could shave a little more weight off, they'd be my everyday specs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've sold my old stuff online off and on for years, but over the last few months or so, I've gone a little crazy with it. The volume of things I have on hand to sell has increased quite a bit, which means I have hundreds of listings up on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/poshmark-app-review" target="_blank">Poshmark</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-apps-for-selling-clothing" target="_blank">other resale sites</a> now&mdash;and when someone buys something, I need to be prepared to find it, wash it, and ship it immediately to keep my high seller rating. For a while, this bedeviled me, but then I started using a time-tested organizational method to keep me on track. </p><h2 id="the-organizational-triangle-streamlines-my-mini-business">The Organizational Triangle streamlines my mini-business</h2><p>I am not delusional enough to consider myself a small business owner, but I do put a lot of work into this endeavor and consider my resale presence online a deeply scaled-down version of a regular retail business. If you've ever worked retail, you know that everything is kept highly organized in the stock room (or that it's <em>supposed </em>to be). My apartment is my stock room. Actually, I turned my entire front closet into my stock room&mdash;and then I used the principles of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/use-the-organizational-triangle-to-declutter" target="_blank">Organizational Triangle</a> to organize it. Those principles are: </p><ol><li><p>Every item needs a home.</p></li><li><p>Keep like with like.</p></li><li><p>Use a "something in, something out" approach.</p></li></ol><h3>Every item needs a home</h3><p>This first step involves making sure every single item you have has someplace it  belongs. Usually, this involves using boxes or storage bins to keep categories of items separate. I use the shelves of my front closet: Workout and lounge sets are on the top shelf, tops are on the next shelf down, shorts, skirts, and pants are on the next one, and so on. </p><p>Keeping my resale goods in a designated resale <em>spot</em>, instead of letting them remain in the closet and shelving units I use for my actual wardrobe, makes it easy to access them and keeps them out of sight until I need them. That makes it simpler to organize my real wardrobe, too, since the things I no longer wear are not in there taking up space.</p><h3>Keep like with like</h3><p>Categorization is a major component of organizing in general. Whether you're organizing your kitchen, your work desk, or, in my case, the closet where all your too-big clothes are waiting to be sold to a new owner, you should be grouping categories of items together. I keep categories separated by shelves within that closet, so when someone buys a skirt from me, I know immediately where it will be. </p><p>Since implementing this step, I've decreased my "average shipping time," which is a metric that counts toward my continued inclusion as a top seller under Poshmark's "Ambassador" program. My average ship time went from three days to two because it no longer takes me forever to find the sold item. I can find it the moment it sells, bring it to the laundromat, and have it to the Post Office much faster than before. </p><h3>Use a "something in, something out" approach</h3><p>This is the part of the Organizational Triangle I was already using for my resales. For years, when I've wanted something simple&mdash;a pink bag, black heels&mdash;I've forced myself to first sell the version I have, then use that money to buy a new one. This means I always have something fresh, but I don't have a bunch of similar items clogging up my space. </p><h2 id="how-and-why-this-has-helped-me-with-resale">How and why this has helped me with resale</h2><p>I don't love that an entire closet in my small apartment has been taken over, but I know that's temporary as I seek to get rid of the clothes that no longer fit me. Eventually, once they're gone, I can start using a smaller storage nook in my loft, organizing it the same way. What I <em>do</em> love is that keeping everything in a designated spot, organizing it by category, and prioritizing a one-out-one-in approach has streamlined my process. </p><p>I'm also a resale buyer, not just a seller. On a handful of occasions, I've purchased an item, waited days for it to ship, and ended up disappointed when the other person messaged me to say they "couldn't find" the thing I bought. I know we're all human, but it's still bad customer service and it sucks. I don't want to do that to anyone else. </p><p>I sell mostly on Poshmark, where feedback from buyers is optional but public. My buyers have included notes that say I'm a fast, efficient, friendly shipper who sends out clean, nice goods as described. I've definitely received more positive reviews since restructuring with the Organizational Triangle. The items waiting to sell are safe and secure in the "resale closet"; I can quickly find and wash them; and my entire process has been sped up. Positive reviews mean more sales&mdash;and more sales mean I'll have that closet cleared out in no time, earn money to buy clothes that fit me better, and succeed more in my endeavor. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>I Use This Surprising Ingredient for an Egg-Free Fried Chicken Crust</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The only bad fried chicken is soggy fried chicken. (And even then, honestly, a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-air-fryers" target="_blank"><u>quick air fry&rsquo;ll fix it</u></a> right up.) However, there are indisputably great ways to get a crackling crust, and those should always be considered. For example, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-should-double-fry-your-chicken-1849619630" target="_blank"><u>the karaage method</u></a> or the copycat <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-make-copycat-fast-food-fried-chicken" target="_blank"><u>fast food method</u></a>. There is another fried chicken trick that I&rsquo;ve recently become aware of, and unlike the other two I mentioned, this one has no extra steps. There&rsquo;s no three-part batter, and it doesn&rsquo;t require a dip in a bowl of (still pricey) eggs. It&rsquo;s one step with a simple flour swap, and it changes everything.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="self-rising-flour-is-key">Self-rising flour is key</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve always used regular all-purpose flour to fry, or potato flour for its superior crisping qualities, but self-rising flour was a complete surprise. This flour, ever-present on my grocery store&rsquo;s shelves, never seemed to be much use to me. For those who also don&rsquo;t use it much, self-rising flour consists of a reliable ratio of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. So if you wanted to make a quick pancake recipe, you could use a scoop of this stuff and skip adding those other two ingredients to your recipe.</p><p>I know that folks in the UK use it often, but I&rsquo;ve always shied away from not being able to control the leavening agent and salt in my baking. But while reading the recipes in <a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/still-we-rise-biscuit-cookbook-review" target="_blank"><em><u>Still We Rise</u></em></a>, a fantastic cookbook with biscuit recipes and recipes for other things you&rsquo;d enjoy with a biscuit nearby, I came across the Glori-Fried Chicken Biscuit Sandwich. You guessed it: The recipe uses self-rising flour.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2 id="an-easy-light-and-crispy-coating">An easy, light, and crispy coating</h2><p>Following the recipe, there is a section of notes called The Gospel of Fried Chicken, and Council (the author) briefly describes why self-rising flour works. The included salt boosts the flavor&mdash;no surprises there&mdash;but the baking powder plays a large role in giving a thin, shattering crust to the fried chicken. There&rsquo;s no need for multiple dredges through flour or egg washes to make the crust as brilliant as it is.&nbsp;</p><p>As a leavening agent, baking powder has the duty to lift up and aerate our cakes and muffins, but it does this even in that thin layer coating your chicken. When hydrated and heated up, the baking powder reacts and produces carbon dioxide. This looks like tiny little bubbles in cakes, but on chicken it produces a delicate, rippling crust.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-to-use-self-rising-flour-for-fried-chicken">How to use self-rising flour for fried chicken</h2><h3>1. Brine</h3><p>Whenever I fry chicken, I prefer to do a buttermilk brine if time affords it. Yogurt will work too, and that&rsquo;s usually what I use. Even one hour can make a difference in how juicy and tender the chicken will be. I brined some skin-on chicken drumsticks in yogurt with a pinch of salt for about an hour. Then I prepared my flour dredge.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Coat the chicken</h3><p>I mixed about three-quarters of a cup of self-rising flour with a half-teaspoon of salt (a little extra is necessary for fried chicken), a teaspoon of cornstarch (which provides <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-should-double-fry-your-chicken-1849619630" target="_blank"><u>extra starch for crunch</u></a>), and a sprinkle of garlic and onion powder.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Then comes the easy part: coating the chicken. I put one drumstick at a time into the flour and coated it completely. Just one time. Then let them dry on a wire rack while I heated the oil.</p><h3>3. Fry the chicken</h3><p>I heated up about an inch of cooking oil in a dutch oven until it reached 350&deg;F and fried until they were deeply browned on all sides and the internal temperature reached 160&deg;F (carryover cooking&mdash;that is, when food continues to cook off the heat for several minutes&mdash;takes care of the remaining five degrees to get it to 165&deg;F).</p><p>With truly the least effort I&rsquo;ve ever put into fried chicken, I made a batch of the best drumsticks I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. And with picnics and backyard parties coming up, you deserve this ease too.</p><p>Although I haven&rsquo;t tried this self-rising flour coating on other fried morsels, like chicken tenders, eggplant, tofu, or zucchini planks, I trust that it would work just as well. Actually, I think I have a pack of tofu in the fridge right now. I know what I must do.</p><p>If you want <em>more</em> egg-free alternatives while prices are still high, I've tested other ideas, including:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-egg-replacements-for-baking" target="_blank">The Five Best Egg Replacements I've Used for Baking (so Far<strong>)</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-substitute-eggs-in-boxed-cake-mix" target="_blank">I Tested Boxed Cake Mix Without the Eggs, and It Was Fantastic</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-egg-wash-replacement" target="_blank">Sour Cream Makes for a Better Egg Wash Than an Actual Egg</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/best-eggless-breakfasts" target="_blank">Eggless Breakfasts to Fuel Your Day (and Spare Your Wallet)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-swap-out-eggs-for-chickpea-liquid" target="_blank">All the Ways Chickpea Liquid Can Replace Eggs in Dessert Recipes</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one likes ads, but they do have their time and a place. If you click on an article, you probably won't be surprised to see them displayed alongside it (unless you have <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/pros-and-cons-of-using-an-ad-blocker" target="_blank">an ad blocker</a> in place, of course). But when your apps start pinging you not with relevant notifications, but with unasked for advertisements, that's a different story. </p><p>That's what some Apple Wallet users experienced today, when the app that's supposed to handle mobile payments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/iphone-customers-upset-by-apple-wallet-ad-pushing-f1-movie/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">pinged them with an ad for Apple's upcoming racing film <em>F1: The Movie</em></a>. According to a screenshot from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1ljfs7u/getting_ads_in_apple_wallet_how_to_disable/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">this Reddit user</a>, the ad reads: "$10 off at Fandango: Save on 2+ tickets to <em>F1 The Movie</em> with APPLEPAYTEN. Ends 6/29. While supplies last. Terms apply." </p><p>A good deal, maybe, but users are not pleased. Put aside the fact that <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">critics seem to be enjoying <em>F1</em></a>&mdash;<em>no one </em>enjoys unsolicited ads, especially from apps that abuse the notification system. Wallet is far from the only app to take this road (here's looking at you, Snapchat) which is why I tend to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-life-is-better-without-notifications-1849653045" target="_blank">disable notifications for all but the most essential apps</a>. </p><p>But what makes this even worse is this is one of Apple's own system apps advertising one of Apple's original films. It feels wrong that Apple can take control of the notifications for one of its apps to tell you to see a movie it produced, just because you happened to buy a smartphone made by Apple. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1ljd94e/disable_fandango_ad_from_apple_pay/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As one user put it</a>, "I did not pay over [$1,000] for an iPhone to get advertised at."</p><p>Unfortunately, that might just be part of the package: Apple has been adding ads to its own apps and services <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-block-apple-s-own-ads-on-your-iphone-1849703889" target="_blank">since 2022</a>, something you might have noticed when browsing the App Store or the Apple News app. Ping notifications are definitely a rarity for Apple, and I hope it stays that way, but Apple might see it in its own best interest to advertise as it wishes across its platforms and services&mdash;even if it's not in the best interest of its customers.</p><p>Luckily, there's something you can do about it&mdash;eventually, anyway.</p><h2 id="how-to-disable-apple-wallets-ads">How to disable Apple Wallet's ads</h2><p>Yes, there is a way to disable these new obtrusive ads without turning off Wallet notifications entirely&mdash;you just need to be running the right version of iOS.</p><p>As it turns out, Apple has added a new notification setting to Wallet in iOS 26, which is <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">currently in beta testing</a>. While I do not recommend installing the beta at this time, especially not solely for disabling Wallet ads, here's how the setting works: Open the Wallet app, tap the three dots in the top right, then choose <strong>Notifications</strong>. Here, disable the toggle for <strong>Offers &amp; Promotions.</strong> That should block these ads from showing up in the future&mdash;at least in Wallet.</p><div class="raw-embed">

</div>
<p>Perhaps at the end of the day, Apple is still the winner in all of this. Not only does this story bring extra attention to Apple's new movie, it also highlights a new quality-of-life feature in iOS 26. Sure, people are pissed, but they got us talking about two different Apple products today. Touch&eacute;, Apple. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</p><p>Target is the last of the major retailers to <a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/release/2025/06/target-to-hold-2024-prices-on-school-supplies-as-it-kicks-off-back-to-school-and-college-season?utm_source=CIS+Press+Alert&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=062325+-+301" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">officially announce its anti-Prime Day sale for 2025</a>. Predictably, the company has scheduled its next Circle Week event to overlap with this year's <a href="https://lifehacker.com/prime-day" target="_blank">super-sized Prime Day</a>. Here is everything you need to know about this sale, and the deals you can expect.</p><h2 id="what-is-targets-circle-week">What is Target's Circle Week?</h2><p>Circle Week is Target&rsquo;s name for its biggest sale. As the name suggests, it lasts a whole week. It used to happen once a year but, much to the dismay of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/16wxkn6/wasnt_target_circle_week_like_two_months_ago/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Target workers</u></a>, it now occurs multiple times a year. The last sale was <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/target-spring-circle-week-details" target="_blank">in the spring</a>, around the time of Amazon's Big Spring Sale. </p><h2 id="when-is-circle-week">When is Circle Week?</h2><p>The next Circle Week will take place from July 6 to July 12. That means it begins two days before Prime Day and ends one day after Prime Day. </p><h2 id="do-you-need-to-be-a-member-to-shop-the-sales-during-target-circle-week">Do you need to be a member to shop the sales during Target Circle Week?</h2><p>Like Amazon's Prime Day sale, you will need to be a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgNKb?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Circle%20member&amp;short_url=aDgNKb&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Circle member</u></a> to take part in the sale, but unlike a Prime membership, Target Circle is free. You can sign up for an account on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbDY5?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Target%20app&amp;short_url=QdbDY5&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Target app</u></a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgybb?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Target.com&amp;short_url=aBgybb&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Target.com</u></a>. </p><p>You can also pay for a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9850rL?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Target%20Circle%20360&amp;short_url=9850rL&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Target Circle 360</a> membership, which grants you early access to the sale as well as other perks, like same-day delivery. If you're a teacher or student, you can save 50% on<strong> </strong>the one-year Circle 360 subscription through Sept. 13; otherwise, it starts at <strong>$10.99</strong> per month. But again, a paid membership isn't necessary to get all the best Circle Week deals.</p><h2 id="what-deals-can-i-find-during-target-circle-week">What deals can I find during Target Circle Week?</h2><p>Circle week will focus on back-to-school items and college essentials like classroom products, dorm d&eacute;cor, and on-trend apparel, but you'll also find tech products on sale. You can shop in person or online, and there will be a "Deal of the Day" for every day of the event.</p><p>While Target hasn't released a list of deals you can expect, you can get a pretty good idea from past Circle Week sales. Here are some of the deals they had at the tail end of the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/target-circle-week-sale-is-still-going" target="_blank">Circle Week last fall</a>.</p><h2 id="what-competitors-are-also-offering-sales">What competitors are also offering sales?</h2><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/everything-we-know-about-amazon-prime-day-2025" target="_blank"><u>Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Day</u></a> will take place between July 8 and July 11, so all the other sales tend to revolve around these dates. Walmart has its <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/walmart-deals-sale-is-walmarts-answer-to-prime-day" target="_blank">Walmart Deals</a> sale from July 8 through July 13, while <a href="https://lifehacker.com/money/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-sale-2025" target="_blank">Best Buy's 'Black Friday in July' sale</a> is running from July 7 through July 13.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Users appreciate the sharp 4K dual&#8209;lens image quality, which includes an 8MP wide-angle lens and built-in spotlights for crisp, colorful footage&mdash;even on dark nights. One standout feature is its ability to pan and tilt (355&deg;/90&deg;) with a 6x hybrid zoom that can track subjects up to 50 feet away. Whether you&rsquo;re monitoring vehicles, people, or pets, it offers an ultra-wide field of view&mdash;ranging from 104&deg; to 38&deg; horizontally and 60&deg; to 21&deg; vertically&mdash;for full-coverage surveillance.</p><p>The camera&rsquo;s dual-band wifi supports both 2.4&#8239;GHz and 5&#8239;GHz networks, and it offers flexible storage options: up to 256GB via microSD (not included), FTP, or a Reolink NVR. Two-way audio allows you to hear what&rsquo;s going on outside your home and speak to anyone who approaches. A time-lapse function is a nice bonus, letting you compress hours of footage into just a few minutes for a quick overview.</p><p>That said, the dual-band wifi has received mixed feedback, with some customers noting occasional connectivity issues. While images are crisp overall, some say clarity degrades and gets blurry when zoomed beyond 2.7x. Some false detections may also be triggered by sensitive motion or noise detection, especially in windy conditions. And since this is a wired camera, it does require a constant power source via an adapter.</p><p>Ultimately, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRb2p?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Reolink%204K%20Wired%20Outdoor%20Security%20Camera&amp;short_url=9wRb2p&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Reolink 4K Wired Outdoor Security Camera</a> is on the expensive side compared to budget outdoor surveillance cameras, it offers solid bang for your buck, especially if you don&rsquo;t want to commit to subscription fees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>The struggle with any piece of home-gym equipment is finding the motivation to actually put it to good use. As I wrote in my initial <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/merach-mini-stepper-review" target="_blank"><u>review</u></a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXwO1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Merach%20Mini%20Stepper&amp;short_url=QVXwO1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Merach Mini Stepper</a> isn't exactly a demanding workout. It's perfect for meeting modest fitness goals or anyone trying to sneak in gentle movement throughout the day. But to achieve this, you do need to make sure you're using your mini stepper for stepping&mdash;and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/merach-mini-stepper-hiding-places-small-apartment" target="_blank">not as home d&eacute;cor</a>.</p><p>The key to actually using your mini stepper (or any piece of workout equipment) consistently lies in setting yourself up for success from day one. Here are the steps to take to transform your mini stepper from a good intention into a daily habit.</p><h2 id="find-your-perfect-spot">Find your perfect spot</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I think the biggest mistake you can make is treating your mini stepper or other workout machine like a piece of luggage, storing it away after each use. Instead, designate a permanent spot where it can live full-time. I promise, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/merach-mini-stepper-hiding-places-small-apartment" target="_blank">it won't be an eyesore</a>. A corner of your living room, bedroom, or home office works perfectly. The easier it is to access, the more likely you'll actually use it.</p><p>I keep my mini-stepper between my living room chair and couch&mdash;perfect to scoot our and get some steps in while I watch TV, because stepping in place can feel monotonous without proper distraction. Create an entertainment zone around your stepper, or position it so you're doing anything but staring at the wall.</p><h2 id="adjust-your-settings">Adjust your settings</h2><p>This mini stepper has two main modes: Stepping up-and-down or twisting side-to-side. When the lever is down, as shown in the photo below, you're set to twist. This twisting motion feels less like a stair climber, and more like you're trying to ski. I know I feel it more in my glutes to keep myself stable during this movement.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Make sure you're using a mode that will hope you meet your fitness goals <em>and </em>that you don't hate so much you'll avoid exercising in the first place.</p><h2 id="set-up-your-display-and-monitoring">Set up your display and monitoring</h2><p>The mini stepper has a basic LCD display that tracks steps, time, and an approximation of calories burned. Of course, like with ellipticals in the gym, the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-cant-trust-your-fitness-tracker-on-calorie-burn" target="_blank"><u>calorie estimates</u></a> are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/dont-trust-the-calorie-count-on-the-elliptical-machine-1834283499" target="_blank"><u>wildly optimistic</u></a>&mdash;you're best off just ignoring those.

<p>Experiment to see what works for you. Press the button once to turn the display on, and then again to toggle through reps per minute, calories, and the duration of your workout. The total step count at the top is untouchable, so if you don't want to see that, you'll have to cover up the whole screen. </p><h2 id="perfect-your-form">Perfect your form</h2><p>Proper form on your Merach Mini Stepper starts with understanding the pedal design. The textured foot pads are designed to accommodate your entire foot&mdash;not just the balls of your feet. Place majority of your foot securely on the platform to engage your entire leg and provides better stability. Keep your weight evenly distributed across both feet, and avoid favoring one side. </p><p>Your stepping motion should be deliberate and controlled: Imagine you're climbing actual stairs rather than bouncing rapidly. Each step should have a brief pause at the bottom to ensure you're not just bouncing on the balls of your feet. </p><p>When you're starting out, find a comfortable pace that you can maintain throughout your workout. Most beginners benefit from 60-80 steps per minute, while more advanced users might work up to 100+ steps per minute.</p><p>This <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXwO1?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=dual-action%20mini%20stepper&amp;short_url=QVXwO1&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">dual-action mini stepper</a> has hydraulic cylinders as opposed to a manual resistance knobs or levers.  system. The resistance should feel smooth and consistent, not jerky or overly difficult. If you hear unusual sounds or feel uneven resistance between pedals, check that both cylinders are in place. </p><h2 id="set-realistic-goals">Set realistic goals</h2><p>Like with any sort of fitness goal, resist the temptation to go all-out on day one. Begin with 10-15 minute sessions and gradually increase by 2-3 minutes each week. Don't be the sort of person who abandons your stepper because it you set an unrealistic goal and lost interest or motivation. If you want to build a long-term habit, consistency trumps intensity. </p><p>The best way to tackle this is to plan a workout schedule&mdash;whatever that looks like for you. You might follow a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmSMzYVzFCo07oHgXxLesOCgykPzp6Htf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">workout video</a>, or simply commit to incorporating your stepper into your nightly TV routine. Morning steppers often find it easier to maintain consistency since fewer daily obstacles arise early in the day. Evening steppers can use it as a way to decompress from work. The best strategy is whichever one helps you stick to your habit.  </p><h2 id="create-a-workout-ritual">Create a workout ritual</h2><p>As a marathon runner, I swear by pre-workout rituals. This might include putting on your workout clothes, filling up your water bottle, queuing up your entertainment, and doing a few dynamic stretches. Having a consistent pre-workout ritual signals to your brain that it's exercise time and helps transition you into the right mindset.</p><p>As mentioned above, it helps to dedicate a show, podcast, or playlist exclusively for your stepping sessions. Anything that creates a positive association and motivation to exercise.</p><h2 id="track-your-progress">Track your progress</h2><p>Whether you use a fitness app, wall calendar, or simple notebook, tracking your stepper sessions provides powerful motivation. Personally, I use <a href="https://lifehacker.com/track-all-your-new-years-resolutions-with-a-ridiculously-detailed-spreadsheet" target="_blank">a spreadsheet</a>. Record the date, duration, and how you felt during each workout. If I've learned anything from Duolingo, it's that seeing your consistency streak grow creates psychological momentum.</p><div class="pogoClear mb-12 mt-10 rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 py-7 shadow-xl md:py-6">

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>The difference between a person who sticks with their stepper and one who doesn't often comes down to consistency. Maybe you'll get sick, go on vacation, or face a particularly busy work period. Decide in advance how you'll handle these situations. Perhaps you'll commit to doing shorter 5-minute sessions when pressed for time, or set a reminder to return to your habit when you're back from vacation. </p><p>Having a plan for overcoming these obstacles prevents temporary breaks from becoming permanent abandonment. Remember, the best piece of exercise equipment is the one you actually use. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's reasonable to assume that if you reach out to tech support from a legitimate help website, you'll be speaking with a real customer service representative. However, scammers are hijacking pages belonging to companies like Netflix, PayPal, and Apple with the goal of stealing your information or gaining remote access to your device.  </p><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/scammers-hijack-websites-of-bank-of-america-netflix-microsoft-and-more-to-insert-fake-phone-number" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Malwarebytes Labs has identified</a> a tech support scam that uses malicious URLs to embed fake phone numbers within legitimate site searches. Here's how to identify and avoid falling victim to this attack. </p><h2 id="how-scammers-are-hijacking-customer-support-pages">How scammers are hijacking customer support pages</h2><p>This scam begins, as many do, with a sponsored ad on Google. If you search for a company's tech support phone number, you may see several (fake) results near the top of the page. Often, clicking these links will take you to a fake phishing website that you can identify by checking the URL, but in some cases, you'll actually land on the legitimate support page with little cause for suspicion. </p><p>However, the number displayed may be fraudulent, and if you call, you'll reach scammers rather than tech support. This type of attack allows cybercriminals to embed phone numbers within an authentic site, where they are prominently displayed. Once on the phone, scammers will request login credentials, financial account information, or even remote access to your device. </p><p>Because the URL is legitimate and the page layout authentic, you may not think twice about calling the number. Malwarebytes has found this attack on sites that include Netflix, PayPal, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Bank of America, and HP.</p><h2 id="red-flags-for-hijacked-tech-support-sites">Red flags for hijacked tech support sites</h2><p>Now that you know that this scam is possible, there are a few signs to watch for. First, check your browser's address bar. There is likely a phone number with lots of encoded characters (%20 or %2B) and/or text like "call now" or "emergency support" in the URL. If the website shows search results and you didn't enter a search term in the on-page search bar, it may be a scam. As always, any language that sounds urgent should also raise suspicion. </p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the only way that scammers can impersonate legitimate companies. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/that-terrifying-call-from-your-mom-might-be-a-scam-1849883646" target="_blank">With call spoofing</a>, fake calls can appear to come from real, known numbers, so if you receive a call back from "tech support" and google the number, it'll show up as the actual company support line. If anything feels off&mdash;there's a sense of urgency or the caller asks for personal information or requests access to your device&mdash;hang up. </p><p>To avoid this, look for company phone numbers by navigating directly to the home page or checking official social media channels. You can also look for contact information in past communication from the company or by logging into your account. Do not rely on search results. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Apple released its second developer beta for iOS 26. While the update is mostly here to fix bugs and glitches found in the first beta, Apple did take the opportunity to include some new features and changes that weren't ready for beta 1&mdash;at least eight, in fact.</p><p>To be clear, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">iOS 26 is currently in beta testing</a>, and is not generally available to the public yet. What's more, this is the developer beta, which is meant for software developers to test their apps within Apple's new OS. While anyone can install the beta on their iPhones, I do not recommend it, as it's still too unstable. You may find your iPhone unusable or lose data if you <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-uninstall-the-ios-26-beta" target="_blank">uninstall the beta without a proper backup</a>. </p><p>Whether you're running the beta or you're just curious about what's new, here are eight of my favorite features and changes I've seen reported from Apple's second iOS 26 beta. </p><h2 id="control-centers-liquid-glass-effect">Control Center's Liquid Glass effect  </h2><p>The first thing you'll probably notice when you install iOS 26 on your iPhone (or any of Apple's upcoming updates, really) is the new <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/first-look-at-apples-new-liquid-glass-style-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">Liquid Glass</a> design. It's hard to miss: All of the UI elements&mdash;including menu bars, windows, and buttons&mdash;now take on a "glassy" effect that shows the elements behind them, albeit blurred and distorted. </p><p>While there are plenty of opinions about this redesign, I think it's pretty cool, and it's refreshing to see Apple mix up its design in a major way for the first time in over a decade. That said, the initial design that rolled out with the first iOS 26 beta wasn't perfect. Control Center, in particular, was a bit of a mess: As usual, it features a grid of tiles, only now they're made of "glass," letting in too much of the background. It's difficult to see; it's messy; it's just not very Apple. </p><p>The company clearly went back to the drawing board for beta 2, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26s-second-beta-tones-down-the-liquid-glass-effect" target="_blank">because Control Center now looks way different</a>. Apple significantly reduced the transparency effect, to the point where I wouldn't blame you for thinking nothing had changed from iOS 18 at all. </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1937208791080304816" title="open in a new window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>It's objectively easier to see the tiles now, but I do wonder if Apple could strike a better balance here. I appreciate the need for visibility and simplicity, but I do like the new glassy look, and it'd be a shame if that design was compromised by the need to reduce the effect too often. It's still early yet, so we'll see where Liquid Glass ends up at the end of beta testing.</p><h2 id="the-transparency-can-be-reduced-even-more">The transparency can be reduced even more </h2><p>Before Apple toned down Control Center's Liquid Glass effect in beta 2, beta testers were looking for ways to reduce the effect on their own. As it happens, "Reduce Transparency," an existing accessibility feature, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-fix-the-liquid-glass-transparent-design" target="_blank">gets the job done</a>, cutting down on the transparent effects throughout iOS. </p><p>With the latest beta, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-everything-new/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Apple has boosted Reduce Transparency's effects</a> even more. It seems like this is going to be the official workaround for limiting Apple's new design, at least at this point.      </p><h2 id="a-new-ringtone">A new ringtone</h2><p>Apple last updated its ringtone selection <a href="https://lifehacker.com/new-iphone-ringtones-in-ios-17-1850835046" target="_blank">with iOS 17 back in 2023</a>. Before that, its tones had stayed the same since iOS 7, save for "<a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-the-iphone-xs-exclusive-new-ringtone-on-your-1820080432" target="_blank">Reflection</a>," the ringtone Apple shipped with the iPhone X in 2017. </p><p>Reflection is now the default ringtone on all iPhones, and while you can change it to any of Apple's other tones (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-makes-it-way-easier-to-set-a-custom-ringtone-on-iphone" target="_blank">or even one of your own</a>), the company would prefer you have <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-iphone-is-getting-a-new-ringtone" target="_blank">another version of Reflection to work with</a>. With beta 2, Apple added Alt 1 as an option under Reflection, with the original ringtone now labeled as "Default." As it happens, the new ringtone was spotted in the IPSW file of the first beta, but Apple only added it to the ringtone settings with this latest update. </p><p>You can hear the new ringtone below. I think it's pretty great, though I'm not sure why Apple was dead-set on calling this an alternate version of Reflection. It sounds different enough to me that it could have been its own ringtone. </p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">

<h2 id="a-new-live-radio-widget">A new "Live Radio" widget</h2><p>Apple Music has a new Home Screen widget: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-adds-new-apple-music-widget-for-your-home-screen/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Live Radio</a>. If you frequently listen to Apple Music's various radio stations, you can add this widget to your iPhone's Home Screen to select a station without needing to open Apple Music first.</p><h2 id="safaris-tab-options-are-back">Safari's tab options are back</h2><p>With the first iOS 26 beta, Apple's redesigned Safari also moved the placement of the tab buttons. If you're using an iPhone with iOS 18, you're likely used to these options being on the bottom of the screen. That's not the case with iOS 26, as Apple moved them to the top.</p><p>Perhaps Apple received one too many complaints from beta testers whose muscle memories failed them while browsing the web, because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-safari-design-change/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">these buttons are now back on the bottom</a>. </p><h2 id="we-now-know-what-low-power-mode-really-does">We now know what Low Power Mode really does</h2><p>You might use Low Power Mode to eke out as much time as possible when your iPhone's battery starts to die&mdash;but do you really know what the feature is doing?</p><p>We've only been able to speculate up until this point, as the current description in iOS 18 says: "Low Power Mode temporarily reduces background activity like downloads and mail fetch until you can fully charge your iPhone." But it clearly does more than this, as anyone with a high-refresh rate iPhone can attest that Low Power Mode cuts the refresh rate of 120Hz to 60Hz.  </p><p>iOS 26 beta 2 gives us <em>much </em>more detail, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-everything-new/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">per MacRumors</a>. The description now reads: "iPhone will temporarily reduce some background activities, processing speed, display refresh rate and brightness, and limit certain features such as 5G, iCloud syncing, mail fetch, and more."</p><p>While this still might not cover all bases, Apple is now confirming that Low Power Mode not only stops apps from running in the background, but also does things like reduce processing speed and limit demanding cellular connections. </p><h2 id="order-tracking-in-apple-wallet-is-now-live">Order tracking in Apple Wallet is now live</h2><p>Apple originally announced the ability to track your orders in Apple Wallet <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-wwdc-2025-live-blog" target="_blank">during WWDC</a>, but as of beta 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-wallet-order-tracking/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">the feature is now live.</a> When you update, you'll see an option to scan the Mail app for orders from companies, which will then appear in Wallet. You can see which orders have been placed, which have shipped, and which are out for delivery. </p><h2 id="apple-confirms-you-can-restore-your-iphone-without-a-mac-or-pc">Apple confirms you can restore your iPhone without a Mac or PC</h2><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-recovery-assistant/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">As MacRumors reports</a>, the initial iOS 26 beta contained the ability to restore your iPhone without a separate computer&mdash;a first for Apple. But with beta 2, Apple confirmed the change in its release notes, saying: "Recovery Assistant is a new way to recover your device if it doesn't start up normally. It can look for problems and attempt to resolve them if found."  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm liking Apple's updates to the Camera app's UI. It's neater and a lot less confusing upon opening the app. At first, there are just the two options&mdash;Photo and Video&mdash;for you to choose from, which makes it really easy to jump right into action. Once you choose how you want to use your camera, you can then access additional options on the same screen, and Apple has reduced the number of times you'll have to go to your iPhone's Settings page for Camera-related tweaks, like choosing which format you want your videos to be saved in. You also have the option of swiping on the Photo or Video buttons to reveal more camera modes. However, my favorite feature is that long-pressing the name of your current camera mode reveals even more options, such as adjusting the exposure, toggling night mode, tweaking the focus, and much more.</p><h2 id="adjust-video-settings-in-the-camera-app">Adjust video settings in the Camera app</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Up until iOS 18, shooting videos could get frustrating pretty quickly. Most of the time, I was still fine, since I only needed to shoot in the default of 1080p in 30 fps. But when I wanted to shoot a 60 fps video, I had to start digging through my Setting app. That has changed in iOS 26. When you open the Camera app in iOS 26 and select the Video mode, you'll see video format details in the top-left corner of the screen. Tap this to quickly change the resolution and frame rate. This is an excellent feature for anyone who regularly uses their iPhone to shoot videos.</p><h2 id="control-your-camera-with-your-airpods">Control your camera with your AirPods</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Many of us now have an iPhone with a Camera Control button (iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max). In iOS 26, the Camera Control button defaults to launching the camera and letting you switch from one camera mode to another. But if you want to tweak other settings while taking photos, you can now go to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Camera Adjustments</strong> and enable <strong>Camera Adjustments</strong>. On this page, you can select the controls you want to access, too. These include Exposure, Depth, Zoom, Styles, and Tone.</p><h2 id="get-a-reminder-to-clean-your-camera">Get a reminder to clean your camera</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With iOS 26, your iPhone can also remind you to clean the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-tells-you-when-your-camera-lens-is-dirty" target="_blank">camera lens when it's dirty</a>. This feature is called Lens Cleaning Hints, and it's available on the iPhone 15 Pro and beyond (which suggests that it may be linked to AI, as those are the phones that are compatible with Apple Intelligence). When your lens is dirty, your iPhone will show a small popover notification at the top of the viewfinder, reminding you to clean it. Once that's done, the popover will disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, if that sounds annoying to you, you can toggle this feature on or off by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Lens Cleaning Hints</strong>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

(Doesn't Samsung know everyone will be busy with Prime Day?) Following a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-galaxy-s25-compares-to-iphone-16" target="_blank"><u>previous Unpacked event</u></a> focused on the Galaxy S25 series, this upcoming announcement is set to focus on the company&rsquo;s newest foldable phones, likely including a look at long-rumored Ultra model. </p><p>This follows precedent&mdash;Samsung usually announces its foldable phones around mid-year. While Samsung won't confirm details until the day of, the announcement headline reads &ldquo;Galaxy Unpacked July 2025: The Ultra Experience Is Ready to Unfold.&rdquo; Plus, a teaser posted to Samsung&rsquo;s YouTube closes with the line &ldquo;Ultra Unfolds.&rdquo; So I think it's pretty clear what we can expect.</p><p>But even if the company has essentially already let the biggest cat out of the bag, that doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t be additional surprises in store. Here&rsquo;s how to watch the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, and what announcements you can expect.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-next-samsung-galaxy-unpacked">How to Watch the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>The next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked will take place on July 9 at 10 a.m. ET. Like past Samsung announcements, you&rsquo;ll be able to follow along live on either <a href="http://Samsung.com" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Samsung.com</u></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Samsung&rsquo;s own YouTube channel</u></a>. In person, it&rsquo;ll be hosted in at a venue in Brooklyn, New York, although it won&rsquo;t be open to the public. (Lifehacker will bring you the latest news from Galaxy Unpacked as it becomes available.)</p><h2 id="what-to-expect-from-the-next-samsung-galaxy-unpacked">What to expect from the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>As Samsung has all but confirmed, this summer's event will most definitely be all about foldables. That means we&rsquo;ll probably get our first glimpses at the seventh Galaxy Z Fold and Flip devices, although it&rsquo;s unclear what form they&rsquo;ll take. </p><h3>An "Ultra" foldable?</h3><p>Samsung&rsquo;s invitation, plus a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-meet-the-next-chapter-of-ultra/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>now deleted post from earlier this month</u></a>, point to an Ultra-branded foldable showing up at some point, but what we don&rsquo;t know is whether it will release in addition to the current Z Fold and Flip lines, or if it will replace one or both entirely.</p><p>Personally, I&rsquo;d lean toward the Ultra being a new option in addition to base models of the Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, but other Android foldables have taken the latter approach, most notably the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review" target="_blank"><u>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</u></a>.</p><h2 id="what-leaks-and-rumors-tell-us-about-samsungs-new-foldables">What leaks and rumors tell us about Samsung's new foldables</h2><p>Regardless of whatever Samsung&rsquo;s new device or devices are called, here's what we already know: In <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>February</u></a>, Android Headlines worked with leaker OnLeaks to post CAD renders of what it suspected to be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>late last week</u></a>, the site posted what it&rsquo;s calling official renders as well. It&rsquo;s still calling this phone the Fold 7, so it&rsquo;s possible the Ultra will be something else entirely, although it&rsquo;s telling that if it is, nothing about it has leaked. Perhaps Samsung is just renaming the Fold 7 to include "Ultra" in the name?</p><h3>A thinner foldable</h3><p>As for the renders, the biggest takeaway is that this phone is likely to be thinner than the Z Fold 6, &ldquo;anywhere from 3.9mm to 4.5mm thin when unfolded.&rdquo; By comparison, the current model is 5.6mm thin when unfolded, while a recent competing foldable, the <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n5/specs/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Oppo Find N5</u></a>, is 4.2mm when unfolded.</p><h3>The return of the pinhole camera</h3><p>Also notable is that the under-display pinhole camera on the internal display seems to have been replaced with a punch hole camera, likely to improve quality. This will mean a slight interruption to your screen space, although it still takes up less real estate than the iPhone&rsquo;s Dynamic Island.</p><h3>A new screen shape</h3><p>The external display also looks a little wider as well, with an aspect ratio more akin to the main display on a non-folding phone. If the leaks come to pass, expect it to be 6.5-inches large overall. And with that wider external display also means a slightly larger, 8.2-inch internal screen, which would be the largest on a foldable.</p><h3>A status quo processor</h3><p>Leaks aren&rsquo;t expecting a major power increase, expecting the phone to run the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip that&rsquo;s in the Galaxy S25 series of phones. Despite the phone being thinner, battery capacity should match prior generations, though.</p><h3>A major camera upgrade&mdash;maybe?</h3><p>One of the leaks&rsquo; bigger called shots relates to the camera, which Android Headlines says will upgrade to a 200MP primary sensor. That might be where the Ultra name is coming from&mdash;that sensor is one of the biggest differentiators on recent non-folding Samsung Ultra-branded phones. I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical, since foldables usually sacrifice camera quality to achieve their form factor, but if this bears fruit, it&rsquo;ll essentially negate one of the biggest reasons to stick with a non-folding phone. Maybe there won&rsquo;t be a base Fold 7 after all, if it&rsquo;s set to have a camera this good.</p><h3>A new Galaxy Z Flip 7</h3><p>As for whatever Samsung&rsquo;s next flip phone will be, leaked details are a bit more sparse. It does seem like one is on the way, and animation renders from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Android Headlines and Onleaks</u></a> point to it having a larger external display more akin to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/razr-ultra-flip-phone-review" target="_blank"><u>Motorola&rsquo;s Razr</u></a>. That means it&rsquo;ll extend around the dual camera lenses for a total of 3.6-inches of screen space overall. The inner display is also set to gain an inch, hitting 6.8-inches, although thickness should remain the same. The phone as a whole might be a little wider, at 75.2mm, but other dimensions should be roughly equivalent to the Z Flip 6, as should camera specs. Processor details aren&rsquo;t yet known.</p><h2 id="what-the-new-devices-will-cost">What the new devices will cost</h2><p>Pricing is a bit contentious. While Android Headlines&rsquo; posts and a statement from leaker <a href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1929167217167380777" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>PandaFlashPro</u></a> claim that prices will stay the same as with previous models, a more recent leak originating from <a href="https://www.nieuwemobiel.nl/062704/25174/Exclusief-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-en-Flip-7-in-winkel-gespot-met-heftige-prijs.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>NieuweMobiel</u></a> and shared by <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/leaked-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-prices-reveal-a-big-increase/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>SamMobile</u></a> showed that an Italian retailer posted a &euro;200 price increase for what it listed as the Fold 7 and a &euro;100 price increase for the Flip 7, which would take the new phones to &euro;2,227 and &euro;1,425, respectively. However, it&rsquo;s possible that this discrepancy could stem from regional differences, a mistake on either the leaker or retailer&rsquo;s part, or confusion stemming from that rumored new Ultra model.</p><p>For concrete details, we&rsquo;ll just have to wait until July 9. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>When you're exercising solo, accountability is key.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/group-fitness-etiquette-i-wish-everyone-knew" target="_blank">I teach spin classes</a> in a gym setting, so I probably sound biased when I say that in-person exercise classes offer indisputable benefits over at-home workouts, but I don't think I'm overstating things. Going to a gym involves multiple baked-in factors to keep you accountable, from the monthly membership fee to the social pressure or working out in a group setting. When you work out at home, you have more flexibility, but you can flex yourself right into not exercising at all. </p><p>That's not to say I'm against working out at home. I love <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-review" target="_blank">my Peloton Bike</a> and ride it every day, and I think one reason for that is the company does a great job of finding ways to make users <em>want</em> to stay on track, even when exercising solo. Today, I hit the milestone of a 100-day Peloton workout streak, and while streaks are effective at motivating my lizard brain, Peloton offers much more than that&mdash;including a feature called Teams that lets you compete with or against your friends or other Peloton users. In recent weeks, I've been testing it out, and I've discovered that Teams is truly effective at creating that in-gym feeling of motivation. </p><h2 id="how-peloton-teams-works">How Peloton Teams works</h2><p>Using Teams, you can work out with friends (or even like-minded strangers), either working jointly toward a pre-determined goal (say, a collective 100 hours of cycling in a month) or competing head-to-head. Your "team" is a group united by whatever you decide&mdash;it can be your friend group, or a group of people who share a common identifier, like being from a certain geographical area or getting back into exercise after giving birth. In short, the feature creates a sense of community in a virtual landscape that can sometimes feel isolating, and it's easy to access from the Peloton app.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-a-peloton-team">How to set up a Peloton Team</h2><p>To set up a Peloton Team, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-app-review" target="_blank">start in the Peloton app on your phone</a>. Along the bottom menu on the home screen, you'll see icons for <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Classes</strong>, an icon that lets you <strong>Track an activity</strong> on the fly, a <strong>Community</strong> icon, and a <strong>Profile </strong>icon. Tap the <strong>Community</strong> icon (it looks like three silhouetted people standing together) and the next screen will give you three options<strong>: Teams</strong>, <strong>Feed</strong>, and <strong>Challenges. </strong>Under <strong>Teams</strong>, you'll see any Teams you're on, plus the option to <strong>Create</strong> one. </p><p>When you tap <strong>Create a Team</strong>, you'll be asked to name it, give it a description, select a color to represent the group, and pick activities for everyone to focus on. You can choose from strength, yoga, meditation, cardio, and more&mdash;or you can pick "all." Then, indicate where the Team is based from a list of major cities, or select "anywhere." Finally, decide if the Team is public or private. Public Teams have activity data available for view by anyone, and anyone can join them. Private Teams are more, well, private, with progress only visible to members. Team admins determine who is allowed to join a private Team.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Once you're done with the basic setup, you'll be taken to a page that shows you the details of the team across five tabs: <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>Feed</strong>, <strong>Challenges</strong>, <strong>Weekly stats</strong>, and <strong>Teammates</strong>. There are a few ways to add teammates&mdash;tap the icon at the top with a silhouette and a plus sign, or the button that says <strong>Invite friends</strong> on the Overview and Teammates tabs. Tapping any of those brings you to a list of the people who follow you on Peloton, and you'll see an <strong>Invite</strong> button next to their name. You can also share the invite link to people with whom you aren't connected on the app, so you can text it to a friend or post it in a forum. </p><h2 id="who-can-be-on-your-peloton-team">Who can be on your Peloton Team</h2><p>Anyone with a Peloton membership can be on your Peloton Team. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr25mm?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Memberships%20range&amp;short_url=Qr25mm&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Memberships range</a> from $12.99 per month if you're just using the app to do things like yoga and stretching, to $44 per month if you have Peloton equipment (like a Bike, Bike+, Tread, or Row) and want to access classes, games, and other features. </p><p>I have the All Access membership, which enables me to do everything from follow along with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-guided-walk-workouts-recommendation" target="_blank">guided walks</a> on my phone to playing a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-lanebreak-rhythm-game-review" target="_blank">beat-based game on my Bike called <em>Lanebreak</em></a>. I recently <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/first-differences-i-noticed-after-upgrading-to-a-peloton-bike-plus" target="_blank">began testing out a Bike+</a>, the upgraded at-home stationary cycle, and I set up my boyfriend with an All Access membership to use on my old Bike so we could test out features like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/how-to-do-joint-peloton-workouts-with-friends" target="_blank">taking classes together</a>. We formed a Team on the first day, though we could have done so even without owning two Pelotons, as app-only members can also participate. </p><h2 id="what-you-do-once-youve-made-a-team">What you do once you've made a Team</h2><p>After you've invited your teammates, it's time to set up some challenges and competitions. Your team will is a permanent fixture, but the challenges and competitions are timed. Say you set a week-long challenge where everyone works to complete a combined 25 workouts: After a week, that challenge will disappear, but the team itself will remain. You can do more than one challenge at a time, and add new ones whenever one expires. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There are two options when creating an activity:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Challenges </strong>create a "shared target goal" that everyone works toward, like the completion of a set number of workouts, a set distance traveled, or a set amount of time spent exercising.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competitions</strong> allow you to set those same workout- or time-based goals, but you're all competing against one another to see who can do the most in a fixed amount of time.</p></li></ul><p>You can check progress on your challenges and competitions from the Overview tab, and get a more detailed view by checking the Challenges and Weekly Stats tabs. The Feed tab shows you everyone's workouts. You can send virtual high-fives to your teammates through the app, too, to keep everyone motivated. </p><h2 id="find-a-team-to-join">Find a Team to join</h2><p>If you don't have a group of Peloton-owning friends, you can join Teams with strangers. From the <strong>Community</strong> tab in the app, tap the <strong>Discover</strong> button. There, you'll find trending teams and featured public teams across a wide variety of classifications&mdash;Pregnant Pelo Mamas, TeamEverySingleDay, MenoPosse, Peloton Digital App Users, etc.&mdash;any of which you can join.

<p>You may not actually know these people, but they can motivate you to exercise the same way strangers at the gym do: Just by existing in your space, even your virtual space.</p><h2 id="how-peloton-teams-keeps-me-moving">How Peloton Teams keeps me moving</h2><p>I usually keep my Peloton profile set to private since I shared my username on my Instagram Stories when I first got my Bike and, as a result, I have a lot of strangers on my in-app friends list and I don't think they need to see a feed of how often I'm using my machine. For this reason, it felt a little unusual for me to share the details of my workout schedule with someone, even though my first Team just consisted of myself and my boyfriend. But after just a day or two of us working on a shared-goal challenge of completing a mere 10 workouts, I started feeling the motivating itch: If I didn't hop on my Bike, my beau would know&mdash;and I'd be letting our team down! </p><p>Just the knowledge that my timely use of the Bike could help us reach our shared goal kept me active and excited to work out. I am also a deeply competitive person, and though we were doing a shared-goal challenge, not a head-to-head competition, it still delivered me a little dopamine shot to check my stats and discover that I did, in fact, beat him by contributing more to our goal over the course of the week-long challenge. </p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>Anything that motivates a person to work out is a good thing in my book, but Peloton Teams is especially useful because it's so easy to set up, and so well integrated with the app you're probably already using. You don't have to coordinate schedules with anyone, since you don't have to be working out at the same time. All you need to do is tap a few buttons, invite teammates, and get going. </p><p>I wasn't sure it would be for me, given I'm generally self-motivating when it comes to my workouts, but I quickly discovered it lit a fire under me like no solo routine schedule could. I've already launched a new challenge for my boyfriend and myself. I expect to win.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This camera is one of the best I've tested, and it's simple to install. You only need to mount it with some screws into the wall or column you want to keep eyes on. Ideally, you want to get direct sunlight in that spot. Mine has never run out of battery, even through the winter in Atlanta. While it can work without direct sunlight, it won't recharge the battery as fast. You can't move the solar panel around, so the placement has to be strategic. However, since the camera pans 360 degrees, the angle it's facing at setup is not important (just make sure it's facing the sun as much as possible).</p><p>The app is the smoothest and most responsive I've used (compared to Reolink, Eufy, and Lorex). It has some nice features, like human tracking, which focuses the camera on a person who walks in the frame and follows them around. At night, it'll record in 2K resolution. There is no subscription fee, but you'll need an <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G5JP?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=SD%20card&amp;short_url=z3G5JP&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>SD card</u></a> for it. It's IP65 weatherproof and compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can also set up alarms and it has a spotlight that activates at night with movement (nowhere near as strong as a spotlight, but enough to deter someone at night from a small porch).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The attachable ear grips help keep these clip-on headphones in place during intense workouts. While they&rsquo;re only rated IPX4 for water resistance&mdash;meaning they&rsquo;re sweat- and rainproof but not designed for full submersion&mdash;they hold up well for most active use. Despite the open-ear design, racetrack-style dynamic drivers provide clear sound.</p><p>While the earbuds aren't the most bass-heavy headphones on the market, Amazon reviewers were surprised by the depth of the bass for the price point and the open-ear style, and a 3D surround setting on the EQ creates a more immersive listening experience. Battery life is another strong point, with up to 30 hours on a single charge. That said, fit varies by ear shape; while some find them comfortable to wear all day, others find them a bit snug, especially after prolonged use. At .19 ounces, they&rsquo;re one of Anker&rsquo;s lightest clip-on earbuds.</p><p>Similar to bone conduction headphones, these don&rsquo;t sit inside the ear canal. Unlike some bulkier models (like <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/shokz-openrun-pro-2" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Shokz</a>), they're slim enough to wear comfortably with hats, glasses, or masks without interference. If you want to hear your surroundings while enjoying your music on a walk, bike ride, commute, or during a gym session, the C30i is worth considering.&nbsp;</p><p>According to customer reviews, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTJQZ3B8?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.2QO23YMA5M8SG&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=lifehacke00b9-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.2QO23YMA5M8SG_1750698354089" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Soundcore C30i Open Earbuds by Anker</a> deliver strong performance for the current $50 price point, offering good value on a budget, especially in hot weather when over-ear headphones can feel stifling. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for noise cancellation or plan to make frequent phone calls in noisy environments, you may want to explore alternative options.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you keep screenshots of login credentials or cryptocurrency seed phrases&mdash;or any sensitive content, really&mdash;in your phone's photo gallery, you should go through and remove them. A spyware campaign targeting images is spreading through apps found on the Apple App and Google Play stores as well as third-party sources. </p><p><a href="https://securelist.com/sparkkitty-ios-android-malware/116793/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Identified by Kaspersky</a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-on-google-play-app-store-stole-your-photos-and-crypto/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">reported by Bleeping Computer</a>, SparkKitty malware gains access to photo galleries on iOS and Android, allowing it to exfiltrate images or data contained within them, possibly with the goal of stealing victims' crypto assets as well as other compromising information. </p><h2 id="sparkkitty-steals-images-and-screenshots">SparkKitty steals images and screenshots</h2><p>If SparkKitty infects your iOS device, it requests permission to access your photo gallery which, if granted, will allow the program to monitor for and exfiltrate new images. On Android, SparkKitty requests storage permissions to access images so that it can upload images along with device identifiers and metadata. It may also use Google ML Kit's optical character recognition (OCR) to specifically target images like screenshots that contain text. </p><p>SparkKitty spreads through malicious apps that have been found (and subsequently removed) on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Kaspersky also discovered the malware in TikTok clones&mdash;distributed via unofficial platforms&mdash;that embed various fake apps, including cryptocurrency stores and gambling and casino apps. </p><p>SparkKitty may be an iteration of SparkCat, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/sparkcat-malware-app-store" target="_blank">a photo-scanning malware</a> that was first identified earlier this year but had likely been circulating for some time. While SparkCat specifically targeted crypto wallets using OCR to identify text keywords, SparkKitty appears to indiscriminately steal images from compromised galleries. Since some SparkKitty delivery vectors have been crypto-themed, Kaspersky researchers believe crypto theft is still the primary goal, though the possibility of other sensitive content being used maliciously&mdash;extortion, for example&mdash;remains. </p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2><p>iOS and Android users can take steps both to minimize or protect the sensitive data stored on their devices as well as limit the risk of falling victim to spyware like SparkKitty in the first place. </p><p>First and foremost, don't keep photos or screenshots of your crypto seed phrase, login credentials, or sensitive content of any kind in your photo gallery. Doing so puts your accounts at risk if your device is compromised in any way, whether by malware or physical theft. Regular logins can be locked in a password manager behind several layers of security. Your crypto seed phrase <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/store-crypto-seed-phrases/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">may be safest</a> split into sections and stored offline. </p><p>You should also exercise caution when downloading apps to your device, whether from the Google Play and Apple App stores or unofficial sources. Unfortunately, you can't trust everything you find even on vetted platforms. Look for red flags: Check the developer's history and scrutinize reviews, especially if there are a lot of glowing reviews relative to the number of downloads. Be wary of requests to access your photo gallery, especially if those permissions aren't related to the app's functionality. In fact, you should pay close attention to permissions requested any time you install a new app&mdash;don't just blindly allow them. </p><p>Finally, ensure Google Play Protect, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-pixel-can-spot-malicious-apps-on-your-phone" target="_blank">which has live threat detection</a>, is active on Android, and keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672563/how-remove-virus-iphone-ipad.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">warning signs of a malware infection</a> on your device. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tech/all-the-ios-26-features-apple-barely-mentioned-at-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">many features and changes included in iOS 26</a> are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26-will-make-managing-your-battery-life-easier-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">a series of helpful battery updates</a> for your iPhone. There's a new charging indicator that appears at the top of the Lock Screen, to let you know how long it'll take to charge your phone to 80 or 100%; a redesigned Battery settings page, which gives you deeper insights into your battery health and usage; and, most notably, a new "Adaptive Power" feature, that can make small changes in your iPhone's performance to boost your battery life&mdash;like a light version of Low Power Mode.  </p><p>They might not be the flashiest of features, especially when to compared to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26s-second-beta-tones-down-the-liquid-glass-effect" target="_blank">Apple's "Liquid Glass" redesign</a>, but they are quite useful. I don't know how it's taken Apple nearly two decades to add a charging estimate to the iPhone, as now you won't have to wonder how long it'll take before your phone has enough juice to leave the house. Adaptive Power, too, is great to have here, since Low Power Mode can take things too far in the name of reducing battery consumption. With this new feature, your iPhone will hopefully still feel as fast and snappy as usual, while lasting a bit longer between charges as well.</p><p>There's only one problem here: Your iPhone might not actually be compatible with Adaptive Power, due to how the feature works under the hood. </p><h2 id="adaptive-power-is-ai-powered">Adaptive Power is AI-powered</h2><p>In order to know when to reduce your iPhone's performance to extend battery life without a noticeable affect on iOS, Apple is tapping into its AI toolkit&mdash;Apple Intelligence. If you have an iPhone 15 or older, you know that your iPhone is not compatible with Apple Intelligence, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-intelligence-on-iphone-requirements" target="_blank">even if the reasoning is a bit dubious</a>. </p><p>Nevertheless, Apple Intelligence features are limited to iPhone 15 Pro and newer, which really means there are only six iPhone models that can run them:</p><ul><li><p>iPhone 15 Pro</p></li><li><p>iPhone 15 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone 16</p></li><li><p>iPhone 16 Plus</p></li><li><p>iPhone 16 Pro</p></li><li><p>iPhone 16 Pro Max</p></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as Adaptive Power uses AI to work, the feature is limited to this list of six devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/21/ios-26-adaptive-power-mode-compatible-iphones/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">MacRumors confirms as much</a>, after testing the battery feature in the first iOS 26 beta. It's far from the only new iOS 26 feature to be <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/these-ios-26-features-require-specific-iphones-to-work" target="_blank">limited to these Apple Intelligence iPhones</a>, too. New features like Live Translation, Visual Intelligence, and the new lens cleaning alert also use AI to function, and, as such, are not included on iOS 26 for older iPhones. </p><p>iOS 26 may run on iPhone 11 or newer, but unless you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, you're not getting the <em>full </em>iOS 26 experience. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/streaming" target="_blank">Streaming</a> services have basically come full circle: What started as a cheap alternative to cable TV has become an expensive monthly cost in its own right, as price hikes and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/netflixs-new-password-sharing-rules-and-how-to-get-aro-1850058887" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="open in a new window">crackdowns</a> on <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/hulu-password-sharing-crackdown" target="_blank">password sharing</a> have made subscribing to multiple <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/movies" target="_blank">streaming services</a> just as expensive, if not more so, than some conventional cable plans. </p><p>Luckily, there are often discounts, deals, and loopholes to exploit that can make streaming more affordable&mdash;and sometimes even free. </p><h2 id="this-months-best-streaming-deals">This month's best streaming deals</h2><p>Two of the better streaming deals right now come bundled with services you might already be paying for.

It keeps the same compact clamshell design while improving on durability, battery life, and AI-driven features. For more folding phone options, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-foldable-phones" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag has a solid roundup</a> worth browsing. And if you&rsquo;re open to all kinds of Android phones, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-android-phones-2025" target="_blank">our 2025 guide to the best ones</a> on the market is a great place to start.</p><p>The phone folds in half to a satisfyingly slim square, which makes it feel less bulky in a pocket or bag than most modern flagships. The 6.7-inch inner screen is bright, sharp, and smooth with its 120Hz <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/from-60hz-to-240hz-refresh-rates-on-phones-explained" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">refresh rate</a>. What&rsquo;s new here is the hinge&mdash;it&rsquo;s sturdier than previous generations and rated <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/dust-resistant-waterproof-making-sense-of-gadget-ratings" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">IP48</a> for dust and water resistance, which is a meaningful step up. Inside, you get a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, 12GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery, all of which translate into noticeably smoother performance and longer uptime compared to the last-gen <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GKBm?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Z%20Flip%205&amp;short_url=z3GKBm&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Z Flip 5</a>.

The crease in the middle is visible&mdash;less distracting than before, but it&rsquo;s there. The outer display is handy for quick interactions and widgets, but is still too cramped for typing or anything beyond glancing at a message. And if photography is your top priority, the dual 12MP cameras do a good job, but they don&rsquo;t quite match up to what you&rsquo;d get on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp3rr?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Samsung%E2%80%99s%20Ultra&amp;short_url=zjp3rr&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">Samsung&rsquo;s Ultra</a> line.

<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good deal for a Wi-Fi 7 router, even if it&rsquo;s a more entry-level option. You&rsquo;re not getting every fancy new feature under the sun, but for most households, this router still covers the basics well. And if you're okay with not having the latest, you might want to check out this <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/the-best-wi-fi-6-routers" target="_blank">guide to the best Wi-Fi 6 routers</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp72d4?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=BE230&amp;short_url=Qp72d4&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">BE230</a> doesn&rsquo;t have a 6GHz band or support for the widest (320MHz) channels, which are two of the more premium features of Wi-Fi 7. But if you don&rsquo;t own devices that specifically use those features&mdash;which most people don&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a huge loss. What you do get is fast dual-band performance, solid range for apartments or small homes, and handy extras like built-in parental controls and network protection. There&rsquo;s a simple app (Tether) for setup, four LAN ports in the back, and support for mesh setups later if you want to expand coverage. Just note that some of the more advanced controls (like content filters or stronger malware protection) require a <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx7lx?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=paid%20subscription&amp;short_url=znx7lx&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">paid subscription</a>, notes this <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/tp-link-archer-be230-be3600-dual-band-wi-fi-7-router" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">PCMag review</a>.</p><p>If your current router is showing its age or struggling to keep up with multiple devices, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DC99N2T8?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.1MBQ8LK4DD3SK&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=lifehacke00b9-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.1MBQ8LK4DD3SK_1750689304851" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">BE230</a> offers a decent step up without getting overly complicated.

            <description>There is so much fake money flowing into fake charities to rescue fake
                dogs.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm fascinated with the fictional information infrastructure in which many of us (arguably all of us) live. The fake-news expanded universe encompasses everything from political propaganda, to conspiracy theories, religious beliefs (except the ones you hold, of course, which are totally true), and that thing your friend told you that time. Also: <em>celebrity dog rescues</em>. </p><p>At the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural stupidity, the unholy spider that spins the giant web of lies in which we are imprisoned has determined that people want to read, click on, and otherwise engage with content involving celebrities who have donated millions to fund dog rescue operations. I don't know why. You don't know why. No one knows why. But that's where we are.</p><h2 id="the-fake-generosity-leaderboard">The fake generosity leaderboard</h2><p>Here's a sample of recent fake stories about celebrity dog-lovers and their fake dog charities, in order of generosity. </p><p><strong>Peyton Manning</strong>: According to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=693568296915640&amp;set=a.347308234874983" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">June 16 Facebook post from "Magic Clement,"</a> washed-up quarterback Peyton Manning bought an existing dog shelter called "Maple Creek Rescue" and fully refurbished it. Magic Clement didn't provide the monetary amount of Manning's donation, so I'm going to estimate $500,000 in fake money.  This makes fake Peyton Manning a cheapskate among fake celebrity dog rescuers, but according to Magic Clement (a Facebook clearing house for AI-generated stories about Peyton Manning being a hero), Manning saved a <em>different</em> dog shelter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=699054879700315&amp;id=100087874264616" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">just today,</a> so he seems to be putting in the most fake effort, at least. For the record: <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dog-rescue-center-peyton-manning/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">No dog shelter called "Maple Creek Rescue" exists</a> and the picture below is AI. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Eminem</strong>: A Facebook page dedicated to the once-controversial rapper proclaims that he made a $10 million investment in a "paradise&rdquo; for stray dogs.

<p>Eagle-eyed readers will note that these images are AI-generated, especially the one at top right, in which Em seems to be wearing a Michael Vick jersey.

He did turn 88 on June 1, though.</p><p><strong>Josh Allen, Jose Altuve, Aidan Hutchinson, Dak Prescott</strong>: These athletes reportedly donated $20 million, each, to establish separate dog sanctuaries. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@simplygoodvibes_/post/DJfpxbni25s" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Actually</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/713508627202333/posts/1130696782150180/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">they</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100079329433302/posts/aidan-hutchinson-took-social-media-by-storm-with-a-shocking-announcement-hes-inv/681482951172680/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">didn't</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/61569627322618/posts/act-of-love-goes-viral-dak-prescott-announces-he-will-invest-20-million-to-build/122127430808654244/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">donate</a> anything, but it seems that $20 million is the going rate for athletes donating to dog sanctuaries. You'd think they'd pool their money and open one gigantic dog rescue center, just for efficiency.  </p><p><strong>Jelly Roll</strong>: Fake Jelly Roll is the king of donating fake money to fake dog charities.

As long as none of the people who post or host this content cares about lying all the time, to everyone, there's a ton of "engagement." But what do the creators of these pages get out of the attention they seek?  Nobody is getting rich off these individual pages, and it's hard to see how some of them even make a pittance. Rocky's K9 Rescue, one of the Facebook pages that spread the fake Morgan Freeman story, says it's taking donations, which at least makes sense (Despite the name, Rocky's K9 Rescue doesn't seem to be connected to actual dog activist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockykanaka/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Rocky Kanaka</a>. Make of that what you will.) One of the dozens of posts I looked at on the fake Jelly Roll page links to a t-shirt that seems related to the singer. </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=magic%20clement" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Magic Clement</a>'s motivations are more mysterious. How does posting an AI-generated story about Peyton Manning <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=696664466606023&amp;set=a.347308234874983" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">saving a library by bringing it books</a> work as a business strategy? (How would bringing more books help keep a library open, for that matter?) Whatever is going on, somehow, at the end of the line, someone has to be making a buck. I'll assume it's Mark Zuckerberg.</p><h2 id="actual-celebrity-dog-philanthropists-probably">Actual celebrity dog philanthropists (probably)</h2><p>Meanwhile, in the real world, many non-fake celebrities have worked with and donated to animal charities that actually exist, including a few who seem to have started something like dog sanctuaries. Reality show personage Lisa Vanderpump founded <a href="https://www.vanderpumpdogs.org/about-us" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Vanderpump Dog Foundation</a>, which lists a "<a href="https://www.vanderpumpdogs.org/the-vanderpump-nursery" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">dog nursery</a>" among its initiatives. Singer Miranda Lambert's <a href="https://muttnation.com/work/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Muttnation Foundation</a> provides grants to animal shelters along with a bunch of other animal-related charitable giving. Singer Ariana Grande's Orange Twins Rescue lists <a href="https://orangetwinsrescue.org/dogs/7K6vLztPkknbPCDfZeuDV8" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">a single dog for adoption on its site</a>. But none of these real stories seem to have the legs of the fake ones. Maybe the money is too small&mdash;none of these charities approach $20 million. Naybe the stars aren't famous enough. But for whatever reason, they just don't pop. </p><p>I checked these celebrity dog charities on Charity Navigator, and Grande's <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/834470477" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Orange Twins Rescue</a> is not listed there (although it is a legitimate non-profit); MuttNation <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/270713907" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">scored a solid 88%</a>; a "good" rating; and Vanderpump's foundation's is rated <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/811263828" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">one out of four stars</a>, or "proceed with caution." </p><h2 id="why-does-this-even-matter">Why does this even matter?</h2><p>With the world's information pipes flooded with fake everything, some sleaze making a fraction of a fraction of a cent by telling lies about Morgan Freeman's charitable work seems like a nothingburger. But it matters. Fake dog charity stories are only a tiny part of a massive worldwide experiment to test what happens to a culture when everything anyone sees, reads, or hears is fake. And you're the lab rat. It's the erosion of shared reality, a complete abandonment of the loose consensus we used to have about the truth&mdash;and the worst part is, there's no one driving the train. I wish there <em>were</em> a shadowy cabal of moneymen brainwashing us for nefarious ends. At least then there'd be a purpose. Instead, our ever-fragile grip on reality is being dissolved by cretins whose greatest life achievement is tricking dummies on Facebook into buying unofficial Jelly Roll t-shirts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The C12 model by Yeedi, a value brand from Ecovacs, has&nbsp;Dual Comb Teeth Arrays and an angled bristle brush, which stops hair from getting tangled, making it ideal for homes with pets. It takes just eight minutes to map your space, and its 5200mAh battery can last up to 300 minutes on a single charge.</p><p>The vacuum is controlled via an app that lets you choose from multiple modes, controlling factors like suction strength, water volume, and dual cleaning modes. While being able to control the device from an app is convenient, some users find it inconsistent and buggy, encountering issues with the app's setup and connection. Despite this, Amazon reviewers who also own Roombas and iRobots say they&rsquo;re equally impressed by the C12&rsquo;s cleaning performance.</p><p>While it&rsquo;s a versatile cleaning device, there are a couple of drawbacks. It doesn&rsquo;t self-clean or auto-empty, and a few reviewers mention that it can get stuck on thresholds between rooms. The mopping function also leans towards more superficial surface cleaning or daily upkeep rather than the deep scrubbing power of pricier models.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZNGJMVR?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.30DL4NUP61873&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=lifehacke00b9-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.30DL4NUP61873_1750697115071" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Yeedi C12 Robot Vacuum Cleaner and Mop</a> offers powerful suction, smart navigation, and customizable cleaning at a fraction of the cost of premium alternatives, making it a decently priced budget buy. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/home/how-to-choose-best-robot-vacuum" target="_blank">If you&rsquo;re looking to upgrade</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wjeV?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=C12%20Pro%20Plus%20is%20currently%20just%20%24100%20more&amp;short_url=a5wjeV&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window">C12 Pro Plus is currently just $100 more</a> and highly rated by reviewers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <title>This Is the Best Way to Build a Smart Home That Won’t Always Be Listening to You</title>

            <description>You don't need to let these companies listen to you 24/7 in order to have a
                few convenient gadgets.</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may earn a commission from links on this page.</p><p>The very first time I turned off my bedroom lights from under the covers, I was sold on smart home tech. There's just one problem: This trick relies on putting a device that's always listening for an activation phrase in a room where you might not want to risk an accidental recording. If that's been a speed bump for you, don't worry: There are ways to build a smart home without all the microphones.</p><h2 id="listening-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be">Listening isn't all it's cracked up to be</h2><p>Before we get into how to avoid always-listening smart speakers, it's worth briefly addressing the <em>actual</em> privacy concern. It's easy (and very common) to get freaked out when you have a conversation about something specific, only to be served ads for that very thing a few hours later. This kind of thing has led to the common misconception that phones, tablets, and yes, smart speakers are recording everything you say to serve you ads. This isn't true, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-people-are-getting-wrong-this-week-phone-surveill-1850658089" target="_blank"><u>but the truth is worse</u></a>. </p><p>In reality, smart speakers are "always listening," but for a specific wake word. Until that word is detected locally, no audio recording is being sent to an external server. If a device <em>were</em> sending audio recordings of everything you say back home, it would actually be pretty easy to detect by <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tap-your-network-and-see-everything-that-happens-1649292940" target="_blank"><u>how much data these devices use on your network</u></a>.</p><p>That doesn't mean there are zero privacy issues, though. Smart speakers can activate by mistake, potentially <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-speakers/yes-your-smart-speaker-is-listening-when-it-should-not/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>as often as once an hour</u></a>. A few seconds of recording every hour isn't the same as constant surveillance, but if you don't want to risk accidentally recording a particularly sensitive few seconds, here are some alternatives.</p><h2 id="use-smart-displays-for-full-home-control">Use smart displays for full-home control</h2><p>While most smart displays also come with always-listening microphones, these can usually be disabled. What you're left with is a screen that you can customize with plenty of smart home controls that let you adjust lights, play music, or watch videos. And in my experience, they're worth the money even without a voice assistant.</p><p>Most smart displays like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbJ66?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Google%20Nest%20Hub&amp;short_url=QdbJ66&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Google Nest Hub</u></a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgpnk?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Show&amp;short_url=aDgpnk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Amazon Echo Show</u></a> have physical switches that will disable the microphone. This prevents any audio recordings, even locally, so you don't have to worry about accidental triggers or software updates that turn it back on. Personally, I still use a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbJA0?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Lenovo%20Smart%20Display&amp;short_url=9gbJA0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Lenovo Smart Display</u></a> that, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/10/23676959/google-third-party-assistant-smart-displays-updates-bard" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>no longer getting updates</u></a>, has a physical slider to block the camera as well.</p><p>With the more surveillance-like elements disabled, what you're left with is a screen with shortcuts to control all of your smart gadgets. My Google smart display, for example, has an always-available shortcut for the kitchen lights, but it's a swipe away to controls for all the other rooms in the house. It's also a handy way to let everyone in the home tweak scenes and adjust the color of lights without needing to give everyone access to a full smart light app.</p><h2 id="customize-your-smartphone-with-even-more-shortcuts">Customize your smartphone with even more shortcuts</h2><p>Smart displays are nice for one central control unit, but the convenience of voice-activated assistants is that you can reach them from anywhere. But why would you need that if your phone is already glued to your hand anyway? Most of us, most of the time, probably don't need much more than a phone to control an entire smart home.</p><p><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/10035441?hl=en" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Android</u></a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118610" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>iOS</u></a> both support customizable smart home widgets, even from your lock screen. The process will be a little different for every manufacturer, but with a little tweaking you can give yourself a panel to quickly turn on or off every gadget you own.</p><p>Home screen widgets are often even more customizable. I've <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-philips-hue-features" target="_blank"><u>used Philips Hue lights for years</u></a>, so I have a collection of shortcuts from the Hue app on a page of my home screen. However, the Google Home app also has its own shortcuts widget that you can customize with whole-room control that encompasses multiple different device categories. So, however you prefer to control your devices, there are options.</p><h2 id="use-voice-commands-on-your-phone-that-you-control">Use voice commands on your phone that you control</h2><p>It's not necessarily the "listening" part that bothers most people, but the "always" part. Fortunately, you don't need to give up on voice controls entirely, if you're willing to use your phone instead of a smart speaker. Gemini on Android and Siri on iOS both support smart home commands, and usually the exact same ones that you would use on their respective smart speakers anyway.</p><p>On Android in particular, the experience is kind of better. See, right now, Google's suite of smart speakers and displays are <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/four-things-i-do-to-make-google-home-easier-to-use" target="_blank"><u>still stuck with Google Assistant</u></a>. It's a clunkier, more finicky voice control scheme. Gemini, on the other hand, has a much better understanding of both time as well as natural-language commands.</p><p>You can <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/why-gemini-is-replacing-google-assistant" target="_blank">set Gemini to be your default voice assistant</a> on Android (it might even already be the default) and use it to control your smart home's devices. You might need to open Gemini's settings and head to <strong>Apps &gt; Device Control</strong> to enable Google Home, but once you do, you can instruct Gemini to control your smart home gadgets. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/saved-info-google-gemini" target="_blank"><u>Gemini's 'Saved Info' feature</u></a> is also a handy tool for tying multiple commands together into a single shortcut.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="you-can-still-use-a-smart-speaker-without-the-microphone">You can still use a smart speaker without the microphone</h2><p>Smart speakers are also, you know, speakers. They can play music, sound alarms, or broadcast messages between rooms. Most of them don't <em>have</em> to always listen to you, either. If you like the convenience of voice commands, but still want your privacy, use that little mute button we mentioned earlier&mdash;that doesn't just apply to smart displays.</p><p>There are a lot of good reasons to build your smart home with devices that might have some privacy implications, but it's not an all-or-nothing situation. In the early days, a lot of smart home gadgets might have made privacy an afterthought, but nowadays, you have a lot more control over when and how your devices listen to you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/apple-wwdc-2025-live-blog" target="_blank">Despite a lengthy WWDC keynote</a>, Apple didn't have time to advertise <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/all-the-ios-26-features-apple-barely-mentioned-at-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">each and every new feature shipping with iOS 26</a>. As such, we continue to learn about new features and smaller changes as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-install-ios-26-right-now-wwdc-2025" target="_blank">beta testers</a> explore the new OS. These testers have sniffed out one new addition that is small, but fun: Your iPhone is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-adds-brand-new-iphone-ringtone-listen-here/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">getting a new ringtone</a>. </p><p>Technically, it's getting a different version of an existing ringtone. At least, that's how Apple apparently sees things: Following the release of <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26s-second-beta-tones-down-the-liquid-glass-effect" target="_blank">iOS 26 beta 2</a>, Apple has, for the first time, added an alternate version of one of its signature ringtones&mdash;specifically, "Reflection," the default iOS ringtone that Apple <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-the-iphone-xs-exclusive-new-ringtone-on-your-1820080432" target="_blank">originally introduced with the iPhone X</a>. Provided Apple doesn't change things between now and the release of the final version of iOS 26, once you've upgraded you'll find a drop down arrow next to "Reflection" in your phone's ringtones settings. Tap that, and you'll see two options: "Default," which is the familiar tone, and "Alt 1." That's your new ringtone. </p><p>What's perhaps more interesting than the tone itself is the fact that keen beta observers actually found it buried in the first beta for iOS 26: While Alt 1 wasn't an option in the Ringtones settings, the sound file itself <em>was </em>present in the IPSW file for the operating system, as <a href="https://x.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1935248131157049700%7Ctwgr%5Ed62d77c7367d8d7d03e44f75c480df0f0fe70683%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2025%2F06%2F19%2Fios-26-beta-hidden-new-ringtone%2F" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">this X user</a> discovered on June 18. You can hear the ringtone itself in the embedded post:</p><blockquote class="twitterEmbed twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700" title="open in a new window" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

</blockquote>

<p>I do hear similarities between the Alt 1 and Default versions of Reflection, but, to be honest, Alt 1 sounds unique enough to my ear to deserve its own entry. Apple could have called this "Rumination" or "Refraction" or anything really, and I don't think many would have complained that it sounded too close to the existing default ringtone. </p><p>To be fair, though, Alt 1 <em>is</em> a pretty cool name for a ringtone. And who knows&mdash;Apple could change the name or make it a separate entry before the OS is officially released. It could also add more alternate tones, or delete Alt 1 entirely. We won't know until the final version of iOS 26 rolls out this fall. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beyond the ability to self-charge, one major perk is that they don&rsquo;t require a monthly paid subscription or have any recurring monthly fees. This eufy cam records locally with 8 GB of storage (roughly two weeks' worth). The AI feature is also helpful in minimizing false alarms from movement generated by pets, cars, or trees, and only detects humans walking in the vicinity. Amazon reviewers appreciate the ease of installation, footage quality at all hours, and the long, powerful signal range.</p><p>These compact cameras can be used together or separately as standalone units. As with most outdoor security cameras, this model has an IP67 rating, making it 100% weatherproof for year-round usage, along with two-way audio that lets you talk to delivery people or ward off unwanted guests directly from the eufy app.</p><p>However, there are some tradeoffs. Color night vision isn&rsquo;t available, and the camera operates on 2.4&#8239;GHz Wi-Fi only, which may be an issue on crowded networks. While it technically supports Alexa and Google Assistant, features like facial recognition, built-in sirens, or expanded storage require pairing with a separate HomeBase 3 hub. Also, changing wifi networks means manually resetting the device every time. Still, if you&rsquo;re looking for outdoor surveillance without the hassle of recharging or battery swaps and you don&rsquo;t require the full bells and whistles of more advanced models like the PC Mag-vetted <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/eufy-solocam-s340-wireless-outdoor-security-camera" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">eufy SoloCam S340</a> (i.e, panning and tilting), this is a value-friendly choice at 13% off.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

And who wants to work when it&rsquo;s scorching hot and you have a pool? Nobody.</p><p>These simple tips will help you dial in your poolside game and get you ready for all the hangs and Marco Polo games ahead.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="make-some-shade">Make some shade </h2><p>The sun&rsquo;s rays are no joke and it&rsquo;s important to set up a UV-resistant patio umbrella (or two) for those all-day hangs. If you have a patio table, it likely already has a hole in the middle for an umbrella. A stand-alone cantilevered umbrella also works well if you want to throw shade over a couple of chaises. Look for a sturdy, heavy base and crank-and-tilt mechanisms, so that you can move the umbrella with the sun.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="let-the-robots-do-the-dirty-work">Let the robots do the dirty work</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Just drop it in and it cleans for up to 10 hours on one charge. Once it&rsquo;s finished, it returns to the surface near your pool&rsquo;s edge and releases water in order to float. It&rsquo;s a cinch to retrieve.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="keep-your-water-sparkling">Keep your water sparkling</h2><p>Yet another perk of the Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra: It features an exclusive <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5gl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=ClearWater%20Clarification%20System&amp;short_url=znx5gl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>ClearWater Clarification System</u></a> that automatically dispenses an eco-friendly water clarifier made from recycled crab shells. The natural solution binds gunk into larger clumps, allowing it to sink to the bottom of your pool, where it&rsquo;s detected and sucked up by the Beatbot.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="water-wings-for-all-your-friends">Water wings for all your friends</h2><p>Keep your pool party-ready by assembling a toy collection that includes big, colorful beach balls, a floating mattress or inflatable chair for lazy lounging, and why not throw in a sparkly unicorn floatie? Water wings are a smart idea if you plan on having kids over at any point. Bendable pool noodles are awesome, too, as you can float on them, use them in your water-aerobics workout, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/14-unexpected-household-uses-for-the-humble-pool-noodle-1850019454" target="_blank"><u>and more</u></a>.</p><h2 id="balance-your-levels">Balance your levels</h2><p>Keeping your pool&rsquo;s chlorine and pH levels balanced is essential, especially if you have kids and lots of friends using your pool. If the acidity or alkaline level is too high or low, it can cause nasty skin irritations and decrease the effectiveness of the chlorine, which is a pool-party foul.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping the balance in check is easy. Just use a pool kit or strip that measures both the chlorine and pH levels. Test your water every day at the beginning of summer, and once you get the numbers where you want them (pH levels should land between 7.2 and 7.8 and chlorine between 1.0 and 3.0 parts per million), a quick test twice a week is all you need.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="stock-up-on-snacks-and-bevs">Stock up on snacks and bevs<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Because you never know when thirsty friends are going to drop in for a dip, you want to always have light refreshments on hand. Keep a separate minifridge somewhere near the pool, if possible, and keep it stocked with frosty beverages for all ages. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to have chips, crackers, and other hunger-busters ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Summer&rsquo;s here, and it&rsquo;s time to prep for the poolside hangs and pool parties ahead. Keep calm and splash on by utilizing a stress-free routine that includes the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5gl?pageview_type=RSS&amp;template=content&amp;module=content_body&amp;element=offer&amp;item=text-link&amp;element_label=Beatbot%20AquaSense%202%20Ultra&amp;short_url=znx5gl&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Ffeed%2Frss" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"><u>Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra</u></a>, and spend your summer enjoying your pool, instead of maintaining it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers who have insurance through Aflac may have had their data stolen. Earlier this month, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/us-insurance-giant-aflac-says-customers-personal-data-stolen-during-cyberattack/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">experienced a cyber attack</a> that compromised personal information belonging to an unknown number of its approximately 50 million policyholders. </p><p>Aflac is just the latest in a string of insurance and healthcare companies targeted by cyber actors. The group believed to be behind this incident is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/insurer-aflac-discloses-cybersecurity-incident-2025-06-20/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">also reportedly responsible</a> for recent hacks at Philadelphia Insurance Companies and Erie Indemnity. In the last year or so, major breaches have also been reported at <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/massive-insurance-data-breach-affects-millions-users" target="_blank">Landmark Admin</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/blue-shield-of-california-exposed-data-of-millions-of-people-to-google" target="_blank">Blue Shield of California</a>, among others. </p><h2 id="how-the-aflac-data-leak-happened">How the Aflac data leak happened</h2><p>Aflac <a href="https://newsroom.aflac.com/2025-06-20-Aflac-Incorporated-Discloses-Cybersecurity-Incident" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">hasn't disclosed many specifics</a> of the cyber incident, which occurred on June 12, other than to say that the "unauthorized party" utilized social engineering to hack into the company's network. These tactics may have included scamming help desks to reset login credentials and bypass multifactor authentication, according to a security expert <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/insurer-aflac-discloses-cybersecurity-incident-2025-06-20/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">interviewed by Reuters</a>. </p><p>Aflac has said that the attack lasted several hours and did not involve ransomware. The compromised data may have included claim information, health information, Social Security numbers, and other "personal information" belonging to Aflac customers, beneficiaries, agents, and employees. </p><h2 id="what-to-do-if-your-data-was-compromised">What to do if your data was compromised</h2><p>As Aflac has not determined how many customers were affected by the breach, the company does not appear to be notifying individuals directly at this time. However, if you are an Aflac policyholder, you can contact the company's call center to receive 24 months of free credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and Medical Shield, which specifically focuses on medical and healthcare data that may be at risk of exposure or fraud. According to Aflac's press release describing the incident, any customer who calls is eligible for these services. </p><p>The call center is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET, and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET through the end of June (so you should call ASAP). The number is 855-361-0305. </p><p>Otherwise, the usual precautions following a data breach apply: Keep an eye on your credit report (<a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">request a free copy each week</a>) and financial statements&mdash;whether you have credit monitoring and identity theft protection set up or not&mdash;for signs of unusual activity. You can go ahead and freeze your credit and place a fraud alert on your file. </p><p>Be wary of unsolicited communication that could be phishing attempts, and never click links, open attachments, or engage in any way with texts, emails, or phone calls from anyone you don't know. You should also proceed with caution if you receive any messages or notices specifically related to your Aflac account: never provide sensitive information to anyone who contacts you out of the blue, and always go directly to the website to log in or access your information. </p>]]></content:encoded>
