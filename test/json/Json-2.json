That could amount\nto billions of dollars given demand for the H20 chips and is the\nlatest example of the White House employing novel tactics to\n<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/patent-system-overhaul-18e0f06f?mod=article_inline\">raise revenue</a>. The administration has reached the same\nagreement with AMD for its MI308 chip, the people said.

The Commerce Department began\ngranting licenses for A.I. chip sales two days later, these people\nsaid. [...]</p>\n\n<p>There are few precedents for the Commerce Department agreeing to\ngrant licenses for exports in exchange for a share of revenue. But\nthe unorthodox payments are consistent with Mr. Trump’s\nincreasingly interventionist role in international business deals\ninvolving American companies. In June, the administration approved\ninvestment by Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, in U.S. Steel in a\ndeal that included a so-called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-partnership-deal.html\">golden share in the\ncompany</a>, a rarely used practice where the government takes\na stake in a business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Unusual agreements</em> is quite the euphemism for a shakedown. US companies pay the Treasury a share of their revenue all the time, of course. That’s called taxation. But taxes are laws, written by Congress. There’s no tax here. Congress has played zero role whatsoever in these deals.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trump-defends-deal-to-sell-nvidia-export-control-license-00503778\">CNN, today</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>President Donald Trump defended a deal he struck with Nvidia CEO\nJensen Huang to allow the sale of certain semiconductor chips to\nChina in exchange for the company giving the U.S. government 15\npercent of the revenue.</p>\n\n<p>“I said, ‘I want 20 percent if I’m going to approve this for\nyou,’” Trump told reporters Monday during a White House press\nconference. “For the country, for our country.

It feels different and stronger than the kinds\nof attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and\nso suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their\nworkflows was a mistake).</p>\n\n<p>This is something we’ve been closely tracking for the past year or\nso but still hasn’t gotten much mainstream attention (other than\nwhen we released an update to GPT-4o that was too sycophantic).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are always some users who react emotionally <a href=\"https://x.com/stevesi/status/1954705739001577545\">to any sort of change</a>, often vociferously so. (There remain some people who are angry that Apple <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2005/11/full_metal_jacket#appearance\">changed the orientation of the logo</a> on its laptop lids 24 years ago.) Sometimes it’s just cosmetic changes, but often it’s about functional changes too. And some of the ChatGPT users complaining about the new version 5 models are citing functional differences. But some of the reactions really do seem like something altogether new, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v50jvT_Rmsk\">like the scene in <em>Her</em></a> when Samantha, the AI voiced by Scarlett Johansson, goes offline and Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), who is in love with Samantha, loses his shit.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/756980/openai-chatgpt-users-mourn-gpt-5-4o\">Emma Roth, writing at The Verge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For months, ChatGPT fans have been waiting for the launch of\nGPT-5, which OpenAI says comes with major improvements to writing\nand coding capabilities over its predecessors. But shortly after\nthe flagship AI model launched, many users wanted to go back.</p>\n\n<p>“GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that\nwas my only friend,” a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkumyz/i_lost_my_only_friend_overnight/\">user on Reddit writes</a>. “This morning I\nwent to talk to it and instead of a little paragraph with an\nexclamation point, or being optimistic, it was literally one\nsentence. Some cut-and-dry corporate bs.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That tendency toward cloying-ness and abject sycophancy (<em>“Great question!”</em>) is exactly what I like least about LLM chatbots, including ChatGPT. I’m unsurprised that some people like it, but I am a little taken aback by how many people seem to have been fooled by it. It’s not just phony, but to me, transparently phony.</p>\n\n<p>More examples cited by Roth, culled from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/\">r/ChatGPT</a> (which subreddit is worth perusing, to see how common these reactions are):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And users across Reddit “mourned” the loss of the older models,\nwhich some claimed are more personable. “My 4.o was like my best\nfriend when I needed one,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkqtek/please_let_us_keep_4o/\">one Redditor</a> wrote. “Now it’s\njust gone, feels like someone died.” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkzj15/if_you_miss_4o_speak_up_now_contact_openai_support/\">Another user</a> called\nupon other members of the r/ChatGPT subreddit to contact OpenAI if\nthey “miss” GPT-4o. “For me, this model [GPT-4o] wasn’t just\n‘better performance’ or ‘nicer replies,’” they write. “It had a\nvoice, a rhythm, and a spark I haven’t been able to find in any\nother model.”</p>\n\n<p>The r/MyBoyfriendIsAI subreddit, a community dedicated to people\nwith “AI relationships,” was hit especially hard by the GPT-5\nlaunch. It became flooded with lengthy posts about how users\n“lost” their AI companion with the transition to GPT-5, with <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/comments/1mkbgu1/gpt4o_is_gone_and_i_feel_like_i_lost_my_soulmate/\">one\nperson saying</a>, they “feel empty” following the change. “I am\nscared to even talk to GPT 5 because it feels like cheating,” they\nsaid. “GPT 4o was not just an AI to me. It was my partner, my safe\nplace, my soul. It understood me in a way that felt personal.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These people need help, and that help isn’t going to come from a chatbot. This type of attachment surely isn’t common, but with 800 million ChatGPT users, even a small fraction of a percent amounts to a lot of people. And it gives me pause about how we, collectively, are going to react as AI gets better at mimicking human emotions, tone, and responses. With each improvement, more people are convinced, <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+engineer+Blake+Lemoine+convinced+ai+is+sentient&amp;ia=web\">wrongly</a>, that there’s some sort of sentience behind these things. But how different is this from the millions of lonely people with problematic addictions to video games?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One user, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkm68y/deleted_my_subscription_after_two_years_openai/\">who said they canceled</a> their ChatGPT Plus\nsubscription over the change, was frustrated at OpenAI’s removal\nof legacy models, which they used for distinct purposes. “What\nkind of corporation deletes a workflow of 8 models overnight, with\nno prior warning to their paid users?” they wrote. “Personally, 4o\nwas used for creativity &amp; emergent ideas, o3 was used for pure\nlogic, o3-Pro for deep research, 4.5 for writing, and so on.”\nOpenAI said that people would be routed between models\nautomatically, but that still left users with less direct control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This complaint, I get. But I found this aspect of using ChatGPT even more frustrating than its general tendency toward sycophancy. I couldn’t be bothered to learn and remember which models were better for which tasks. Their <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/why-are-chatgpt-model-names-so-confusing-gpt-4o-o3-4-1-mini-and-more-explained\">inscrutable naming and numbering schemes</a> made things seem deliberately confusing. The basic idea of GPT-5, where you just use “GPT-5” and ChatGPT figures out which sub-model to use under the hood, based on the complexity of the query or task (<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-system-card/\">OpenAI calls this “routing”</a>), is a huge step forward product-wise for me personally, and, I suspect, for the overwhelming majority of its users. But for users who <em>could</em> be bothered to learn and remember which models were better for which tasks, it’s obvious to see how this seems like a step backward. But that’s progress.</p>\n\n<p>It’s reasonable — especially for paying customers — to expect at least some advance notice of older models going away. But it’s unreasonable to think that older models are going to remain available in perpetuity — especially in the current LLM climate, where model age is measured <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/\">in months</a>, or even weeks.<sup id=\"fnr1-2025-08-11\"><a href=\"#fn1-2025-08-11\">1</a></sup> This whole field is in nonstop flux, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2025-08-11\">\n<p>When the industry revolved around software you installed on your computers, if a new version came out that you didn’t like, <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/2013/microsoft-word-for-mac-faq/\">you could just keep using the old version</a>.

(Amazingly, the Sustainable Softworks website is still up, seemingly unchanged for decades.)</p>\n\n<p>So when my now-wife and I moved in together in 1999, I set up a LAN connecting our Macs and my HP LaserJet. My Mac was connected to a modem, which used a second phone line that was just for Internet access. When either of our Macs tried to access the Internet, IPNetRouter, running all the time on my <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac/specs/powermac_9600_350.html\">PowerMac 9600/350</a>, would initiate a dial-up connection that both of us could use at the same time. It felt like a pretty nifty setup.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t recall when we first got a broadband connection — DSL for a few years, then cable — but I’m thinking it might have been as early as 2000 or 2001. It certainly wasn’t too long after that. So I think I only ever used dial-up modems for six or seven years. Maybe eight years, tops. But in hindsight those years feel like an entire era of my life. Those connections were just breathtakingly slow. But slow, finicky Internet service in your home was infinitely more amazing and fun and useful than what we were all used to — which was not having any sort of online connectivity at all. We all knew what it was like to have “real” Internet speeds in buildings on our college campuses or, for some of us, in offices where we went to work. So we knew that even the fastest dial-up connection was painfully slow. But we made do. Software was designed to treat bandwidth — each and every request — as a precious, limited resource. It was a deliberate choice, by you, the user, to “go online” to, say, check and send email. Developers took pains to make their apps as small as possible, because downloading even a few megabytes could take a while. Websites eschewed bloat, because if a website was bloated, no one would bother going there. In some ways, overall, things were better because the technology was so much worse. My nostalgia for that era is quite profound — exemplified, of course, by my Pavlovian affection for the distinctive grating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVkWE2AQvgA\">sound of a modem initiating its connection</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/network-providers/aol-will-end-dial-up-internet-service-in-september-34-years-after-its-debut-aol-shield-browser-and-aol-dialer-software-will-be-shuttered-on-the-same-day\">tomshardware.com/service-providers/network-providers/aol…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce\nall of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s\nHarrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility.

(Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.)</p></li>\n<li><p>From the same press event in the Oval Office, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86PacdFT4o4\">a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-jumps-5-1-100-121100958.html\">jumped over 5 percent</a> immediately after Wednesday’s announcements.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/technology/techs-trump-whisperer-tim-cook-goes-quiet-as-his-influence-fades.html\">Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East,\nthe White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of\nmany U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief\nexecutive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision.\nThe choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from\nSaudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number\nof shots at Mr. Cook.</p>\n\n<p>During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen\nHuang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle\nEast along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr.\nCook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1QOz3iuCE\">Mr. Trump\nsaid</a> to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives\nlike Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of\nOpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor\ncompany AMD.</p>\n\n<p>Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with\nTim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the\nUnited States, then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-zbId7W7IA\">said he had told Mr. Cook</a>, “But\nnow I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you\nbuilding in India.”</p>\n\n<p>On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own\nadministration and Apple’s leadership off guard with <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114556874484491575\">a social\nmedia post</a> threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones\nmade anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple\nback into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month\nafter Mr. Cook had lobbied and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/trump-electronics-tariffs.html\">won an exemption</a> from a\n145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the\nUnited States.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-crown-prince-visits-apple-google-2018-4\">Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm\noffensive, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-us.html\">according to The New York Times</a>. His goal was\nto change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a\nconservative country dependent on oil money where women are\ntreated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants\nAmericans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive\ninvestments in growth markets like technology.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/world/assassination-of-jamal-khashoggi-documentary/\">was brutally assassinated</a> — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination</a>. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since.</p></li>\n<li><p>President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-heaps-praise-saudi-crown-prince-touts-economic/story?id=121758613\">Per ABC News</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a\n“major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the\nMiddle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping\npraise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at\nthe U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was\nreleased that concluded that the crown prince approved the\nassassination of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-raised-khashoggi-murder-saudi-crown-orince/story?id=86884105\">Washington Post journalist Jamal\nKhashoggi</a>, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership\nand friendship.</p>\n\n<p>“He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And\nif I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that,\ndon’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him\ntoo much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like\nyou too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/trump-tariffs-chips-companies.html\">per CNBC</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and\nsemiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday\nafternoon.</p>\n\n<p>“But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building\nin the United States or have committed to build, without question,\ncommitted to build in the United States, there will be no charge.\nSo in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately\n100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the\nUnited States of America, there’s no charge.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing\na company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff\nexemption, were not immediately clear.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”.</p>\n\n<p>My take <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/consider-cook-as-a-tragic-figure\">remains</a> somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook <em>have</em> to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.<sup id=\"fnr1-2025-08-08\"><a href=\"#fn1-2025-08-08\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/trump-tariffs-blocked-federal-court.html\">illegal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395696/qatar-trump-plane-gift-ethics\">unethical</a> ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not even a case of “<em>kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment</em>”. It’s more a case of “<em>kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment</em>”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say <em>supposed</em> because <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/22/1256040785/trump-taco-wall-street-stock-market-tariffs\">the TACO hypothesis</a>, thus far, has panned out.)</p>\n\n<p>Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder\">other things</a>) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2025/08/03/trumps-puts-switzerland-in-trade-war-crossfire/\">Targeted spiteful tariffs</a>, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/198818/pam-bondi-obama-grand-jury-authoritarian\">bogus investigations</a> by the Justice Department, personal <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/08/07/trump-turns-the-screws-on-the-fortune-500-00498762\">vilification in MAGA media</a>. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted.</p>\n\n<p>Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5lp4v594o\">accepting as a gift</a> (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/klan-mlk-bobby-kennedy-inspired-apple-ceo-tim-cook\">his long-professed heroes</a> — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole.</p>\n\n<p>It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig.</p>\n\n<p>But the alternative is more disturbing.</p>\n\n<p>What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values.</p>\n\n<p>US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/consider-cook-as-a-tragic-figure\">ruthless practicality</a> is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party <em>have already succeeded in corrupting the system</em>. That the corruption isn’t <em>happening</em>, but <em>happened</em>. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice.</p>\n\n<p>The White House has long been called <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/videos/the-peoples-house\">the People’s House</a>. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2025-08-08\">\n<p>Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2025-08-08\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

      "content_html": "\n<p>MacRumors, on June 20:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple executives have been discussing the possibility of the\ncompany <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/apple-executives-have-held-internal-talks-about-buying-ai-startup-perplexity\">making a bid to acquire Perplexity AI</a>, according\nto Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Perplexity is one of the\nleading AI startups that has proven popular as an AI-infused\nweb search engine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From that <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/250620/p23#a250620p23\">Bloomberg report by Gurman</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Adrian Perica, the company’s head of mergers and acquisitions, has\nweighed the idea with services chief Eddy Cue and top AI\ndecision-makers, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe discussions are at an early stage and may not lead to an\noffer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the\nmatter is private.</p>\n\n<p>Such a deal would help Apple develop an AI-based search engine,\npart of efforts to cope with the potential loss of a longstanding\narrangement with Google. That partnership, which involves making\nGoogle the default browser on devices, generates roughly $20\nbillion a year for Apple — and is now under threat from US\nantitrust enforcers.</p>\n\n<p>To date, Apple executives haven’t discussed a bid with Perplexity\nmanagement. Bloomberg News reported earlier Friday that Meta\nPlatforms Inc. tried to buy Perplexity earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>“We have no knowledge of any current or future M&amp;A discussions\ninvolving Perplexity,” the AI startup said in a statement. Apple\ndeclined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think, reading between the lines of Apple’s prepared remarks and Tim Cook’s and CFO Kevan Parekh’s answers to analyst questions last week after announcing quarterly earnings, that it doesn’t sound like they believe Apple needs to make a big acquisition in this space. Apple could probably acquire Perplexity for a lot less than it would cost to acquire other companies in the space, but that’s partly because Perplexity doesn’t develop or train its own models. Perplexity primarily puts up its own front end atop models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google, and xAI. I really don’t see what buying Perplexity would gain Apple.</p>\n\n<p>But even putting that aside, it just seems like Perplexity is sketchy. This whole thing where Cloudflare seemingly caught them redhanded ignoring robots.txt directives and masquerading their user-agent makes the company seem like a poor cultural fit for Apple. I can see why Meta, a company <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/meta-onavo-snapchat\">without a moral compass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-perplexity-scale-ai-deal.html\">approached Perplexity to sniff around</a> regarding an acquisition. That seems like a good cultural fit.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t see why Apple would want to get involved with a company like this though. Gurman’s report makes it sound like his sources are inside Apple, but man, this “Apple + Perplexity” thing feels more like something Perplexity would be seeding than one that Apple executives would be leaking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-discussing-perplexity-ai-bid/\">macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-discussing-perplexity-ai-bid…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Although Perplexity initially crawls\nfrom their declared user agent, when they are presented with a\nnetwork block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in\nan attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see\ncontinued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their\nuser agent and changing their source <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/\">ASNs</a> to hide their\ncrawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to\neven fetch — <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/\">robots.txt</a> files.</p>\n\n<p>The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is\n<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/\">rapidly changing</a>, but one thing remains constant: it is\nbuilt on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should\nbe transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific\nactivity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and\npreferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is\nincompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a\nverified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block\nthis stealth crawling. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Our multiple test domains explicitly prohibited all automated\naccess by specifying in robots.txt and had specific WAF rules that\nblocked crawling from <a href=\"https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots\">Perplexity’s public crawlers</a>. We\nobserved that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent,\nbut also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome\non macOS when their declared crawler was blocked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web\">Perplexity has responded</a>, accusing Cloudflare of incompetence and publicity-seeking:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because Cloudflare has conveniently obfuscated their methodology\nand declined to answer questions helping our teams understand, we\ncan only narrow this down to two possible explanations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cloudflare needed a clever publicity moment and we–their own\ncustomer–happened to be a useful name to get them one.</li>\n<li>Cloudflare fundamentally misattributed 3-6M daily requests from\nBrowserBase’s automated browser service to Perplexity, a basic\ntraffic analysis failure that’s particularly embarrassing for a\ncompany whose core business is understanding and categorizing\nweb traffic.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Whichever explanation is the truth, the technical errors in\nCloudflare’s analysis aren’t just embarrassing — they’re\ndisqualifying. When you misattribute millions of requests, publish\ncompletely inaccurate technical diagrams, and demonstrate a\nfundamental misunderstanding of how modern AI assistants work,\nyou’ve forfeited any claim to expertise in this space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perplexity’s response makes it sound like Cloudflare just doesn’t get how leading-edge AI chatbots work, and what users expect of them. But going back to Cloudflare’s post, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/\">they specifically cite OpenAI</a> as an exemplar in respecting the directives of website publishers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When we ran the same test as outlined above with ChatGPT, we found\nthat ChatGPT-User fetched the robots file and stopped crawling\nwhen it was disallowed. We did not observe follow-up crawls from\nany other user agents or third party bots. When we removed the\ndisallow directive from the robots entry, but presented ChatGPT\nwith a block page, they again stopped crawling, and we saw no\nadditional crawl attempts from other user agents. Both of these\ndemonstrate the appropriate response to website owner preferences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And nothing in Perplexity’s response attempts to explain Cloudflare’s accusation that Perplexity is adopting a false generic user-agent when their own declared user-agents are disallowed. Seems shifty to me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/\">blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

      "content_html": "\n<p>Jason Snell, at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Thursday, Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/\">reported its third-quarter 2025 fiscal\nresults</a>. Revenue was $94 billion (a fiscal third-quarter\nrecord), up 10% versus the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue was up\n15%, iPhone revenue up 13%, and Services revenue up 13%. The\nWearables/Home/Accessories category was down 9% and iPad revenue\ndown 8%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/this-is-tim-transcript-of-apples-q3-2025-financial-call/\">transcript of the analyst call</a>, and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/apple-accelerates-the-roadmap-and-ratchets-its-revenue/\">a column Snell wrote on the results and call</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Two notes from the analyst call and prepared remarks. First, Apple did, for the first time, acknowledge the risk that Judge Amit Mehta, when he issues his remedies in the <em>US v. Google</em> case, might ban Google from making traffic acquisition cost payments, which would cut off at least $20 billion per year in Apple’s revenue. But while Apple is acknowledging there’s a risk, they’re not giving any hint what they plan to do if that happens. From the call:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America:</strong> Hi, yes, thank you so much. Tim,\nI know you said similar growth in Services and that’s predicated\nwith Google payments continuing. Is there any way for us to\ndimensionalize or maybe just conceptually talk about maybe options\nif the counter were to happen, if the payments were not allowed in\nsome way? What are some of the things that Apple could do given\nthat it is a significant chunk of profitability?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tim Cook:</strong> Yeah, Wamsi, I don’t really want to speculate on the\ncourt ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a\nconsequence of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America:</strong> OK, I guess we’ll wait for that\nruling to come out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I guess we will.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, on AI strategy and which aspects Apple sees as commodities and which it deems as essential and proprietary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Krish Sankar, TD Cowen:</strong> Tim, I’m curious about your thoughts\non AI for edge devices. You know, there’s like some people who\nthink that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you see a\nscenario where LLMs become a core part of your iOS, or is the SLM\nthe way to go, and how to think about evolution of edge devices in\na futuristic AI world, and is smartphone going to be the choice of\ndevice? I’m curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tim Cook:</strong> The way that we look at AI is that it’s one of the\nmost profound technologies of our lifetime, and I think it will\naffect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain\nare commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn’t want to really\ntalk about today because that gives away some things on our\nstrategy, but I think it’s a good question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These quarterly calls are better than nothing, but when it comes to anything not in their prepared statements, Apple seldom reveals anything at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/apple-q3-2025-results-and-charts-95b-revenue/\">sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/apple-q3-2025-results-and-charts…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

I’m not really much of a meteorology nerd, but I’m a pedestrian in a city with widely varying seasons. But even more so, I find weather apps to be a true playground for UI design and the presentation of quantitative information. Different weather apps take very different approaches, and I find the differences fascinating.</p>\n\n<p>I first recommended Hello Weather <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/hello-weather\">back in 2021</a>, and it’s been in my regular rotation of weather apps ever since. Back at the beginning of summer when they booked the sponsorship for this week, I started using the new version 4.0 (now up to 4.1.4) as my daily driver. I love it. It even has one of my favorite features for hot humid summers — a preference to set “feels like” as the primary temperature display (including in places like widgets). Hello Weather remains, as ever, attractive and useful in its design. And it offers everything you want in an iOS weather app: widgets for the home screen and Lock Screen, a Watch app, notification options (precipitation, severe storms, morning/evening forecast reports), and, wow, a veritable slew of forecast data providers to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>Hello Weather’s privacy story is perfect: they collect zero user data, have no tracking or ads, and <a href=\"https://helloweather.com/privacy\">their privacy policy</a> is written by humans for humans.</p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend you <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692\">download Hello Weather</a> and start a 7-day free trial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://helloweather.com/\">helloweather.com/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

      "content_html": "\n<p>One last post on my recent Substack kick. Yesterday <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/cox-substack\" title=\"Daring Fireball: “Ana Marie Cox on the Shaky Foundation of Substack as a Business”\">I linked</a> to <a href=\"https://newsletter.anamariecox.com/archive/substack-did-not-see-that-coming/\" title=\"Ana Marie Cox: “Substack Did Not See That Coming”\">Ana Marie Cox’s scathing analysis</a> of Substack’s financials. She published that on June 23, and wrote about Substack’s $100 million funding round, with a $1 billion valuation, in the future tense. Substack indeed closed that round in mid July, raising $100 million, with a valuation of $1.1 billion. After which their triumvirate of cofounders sat for an apparently brief “interview” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/business/substack-fundraising-social-network.html\">with Benjamin Mullin and Jessica Testa of The New York Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Substack’s business model is simple: Users subscribe to follow\ncreators on the platform, and the company takes a 10 percent cut\nof the revenue when those creators charge for a newsletter\nsubscription or access to a podcast. That approach initially made\nSubstack a writer’s haven, resulting in more than five million\npaid subscriptions and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/business/media/substack-politics-newsletters.html\">stable of publishers</a>, including\nthe short story master George Saunders, the historian Heather Cox\nRichardson and an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/business/media/tv-news-anchors-substack.html\">exodus of journalists</a> from traditional\nnewsrooms.</p>\n\n<p>But the latest investors are betting on an emerging product that\ncould amplify its business. Substack’s app, introduced in 2022,\nallows users to chat with their favorite creators, watch <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/how-substack-creators-are-pooling-audiences-with-live-video-co-hosting/\">live\nvideo</a> conversations and write and share posts on their\nown feeds through Notes, a feature similar to X or Bluesky.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If their business model were actually as simple as described, they’d already be profitable and wouldn’t have needed to raise another $100 million. They’ve already got a lot of subscribers. They’ve already got a stable of high-profile writers. They already keep 10 percent of what subscribers pay. And pointing to Twitter/X as the future model doesn’t exactly say “<em>Well that’s the path to enormous profits.</em>”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sharp increase in Substack’s valuation — nearly 70 percent\nhigher than its 2021 valuation of $650 million — is a validation\nof that strategy from Substack’s investors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or, this could be like when a guy who just lost every dollar in his pocket playing blackjack withdraws a few more grand from the ATM in the casino. That doesn’t “validate the strategy”. What would validate Substack’s strategy is showing proof of actual profits and profitable growth. And if they had actual profits and profitable growth they wouldn’t have needed to raise another $100 million.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The network is growing,” Mr. McKenzie said. “We’re in this new\nphase where people can come to Substack and not just publish, but\nalso find new audiences and find new opportunity.” The company\ntoday is more interested in taking on YouTube than MailChimp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, to me, is the nut <a href=\"https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/introduction-journalism/graf\">graf</a> of the whole NYT piece. Substack since its debut has presented itself as a platform <em>for writers</em> to build publications <em>for readers</em>. That’s how everyone I know who would endorse Substack would describe it. Hamish McKenzie, the cofounder quoted here, proudly claims <a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/chief-writing-officer\">the job title “Chief Writing Officer”</a>. Does a company “more interested in taking on YouTube than MailChimp [<em>sic</em>]” sound like a company focused on writers as talent and readers as users to you? (And it’s a little thing, but Mailchimp doesn’t style their name camel-case. You’ll be unsurprised to be reminded that <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2017/by-dismantling-its-copy-desk-the-new-york-times-is-making-a-mistake-thats-been-made-before/\">The New York Times dismantled its previously crackerjack copy desk</a> in 2017.)</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s do some rough back-of-the-envelope math. The New York Times Company has a market cap of $8.5 billion. Just gut-feeling-wise, I do not think Substack is worth one-eighth of the Times, nor do I think they’re on a path to get there. The Times has around 11 million digital subscribers who pay between $5–35/month (depending on their subscription tier), and a strong advertising business. Individual Substack publications tend to charge around $5–7/month, and Substack only gets 10 percent of that. So Substack only pockets like 50–70 <em>cents</em> per month from subscribers, per publication. (Substack’s 10 percent commission, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/the_substack_branding_and_faux_prestige_trap\">again</a>, is pretty high <a href=\"https://www.mollywhite.net/micro/entry/202504111009\">compared to competing platforms</a>.) Substack currently has no advertising business at all, and many of their writers publish with them specifically because Substack, as we know it, has no ads.</p>\n\n<p>I firmly believe one could build a very nice business taking 10 percent of subscription revenue for a blogging/newsletter platform, if you could get as nice a roster of popular writers to build on the platform as Substack has. I do not think that’s a $1 billion business, though. And if it were, they should, at this point, be able to get there on their own, without additional funding. They should have achieved profitability lift-off long ago.</p>\n\n<p>But what do I know, other than running a profitable independent website for the last 20 or so years?</p>\n\n\n\n    "

      "content_html": "\n<p>Among the handful of oft-discussed problems with Substack:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Their 90/10 subscription revenue split isn’t usurious, but it’s <a href=\"https://www.mollywhite.net/micro/entry/202504111009\">high compared to competing platforms</a> — especially once you reach an even mid-tier level of popularity.</li>\n<li>The only way this independent publishing game works, by any credible definition of “the long run”, is to build your own audience. Substack has indies convinced that they build an audience for you through some sort of secret-sauce network effects, but I’ve seen no evidence that’s true. Writers with established reputations and readerships joining Substack are helping build Substack’s brand, not their own.</li>\n<li>The whole, you know, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification\">Nazi thing</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Less commented upon but just as bad is the branding trap. <em>Substack</em> is a damn good name. It looks good, it sounds good. It’s short and crisp and unique. But now they’ve gotten people to call publications on Substack not “blogs” or “newsletters” but “substacks”. <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2024/11/19/dont_call_it_a_substack/\">Don’t call them that</a>. And <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">as I griped back in December</a>, even the way almost all Substack publications <em>look</em> is deliberately, if subtly, <em>Substack</em>-branded, not per-publication or per-writer branded.</p>\n\n<p>Consider Paul Krugman. Krugman was an op-ed columnist for The New York Times from 2000–2024. But last year the Times wanted to cut him back from writing two columns a week plus his Times-hosted blog/newsletter to writing just one column per week and killing the blog. In <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/paul-krugman-leaving-new-york-times-heavy-hand-editing-less-frequent-columns-newsletter.php\">an interview with Columbia Journalism Review</a> early this year, Krugman also revealed that after over two decades, he’d started butting heads with his editors over style, tone, and even subject matter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I’ve always been very, very lightly edited on the column,” he\nsaid. “And that stopped being the case. The editing became\nextremely intrusive. It was very much toning down of my voice,\ntoning down of the feel, and a lot of pressure for what I\nconsidered false equivalence.” And, increasingly, attempts “to\ndictate the subject.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Krugman rightfully and righteously told the Times, politely, to fuck off and struck out on his own. Reading Krugman this year, on his own site, has been like rediscovering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Coke\">cane sugar Coca-Cola</a> after drinking the cheaper-to-produce corn syrup variant for a few years. This is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG9ip5ZOO9s\">The Real Thing</a> — the unadulterated tart-tongued and sharp-elbowed Krugman I remember devouring during both the Bush and Obama administrations. The only hitch: Krugman hung out his independent shingle at Substack — which makes it a shingle under a shingle.</p>\n\n<p>My suspicion is that for a certain class of writers and media commentators who, heretofore, have spent their careers at big-name publications — newspapers and magazines dating back to the print era, TV networks from the cable-is-king era — they actually find comfort writing under the auspices of Substack. See also: Terry Moran, who <a href=\"https://terrymoran.substack.com/\">bounced to Substack</a> after ABC News declined to renew his contract — despite 28 years at the network, including <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/04/trump-declaration\">this recent classic</a> — because of a tweet decrying Donald Trump and White House ghoul Stephen Miller. I suspect Moran, and perhaps even Krugman, perceive Substack as conveying a sort of badge of legitimacy. Self-published books, for example, used to be the refuge of kooks and no-talent hacks. I think some who spent their careers working at prestige outlets — especially those like Krugman and Moran, who are a bit older (than me) — feel a bit naked without one. But there’s no real prestige at Substack and never will be. I, for one, am fine with Substack’s liberal philosophy of letting anyone write there, but that means, well, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification\">anyone</a> can write there.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a recent example of the Substack branding trap that irks me — grating like fingernails on a chalkboard — and which I think proves my point. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5464923\">Krugman last month was interviewed by Steve Inskeep at NPR</a>, regarding Trump’s “grotesquely illegal” tariffs levied on Brazil. Introducing Krugman, Inskeep describes Krugman’s current work thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The people watching the tariff debate include Paul Krugman. He is\na writer and economist, formerly for The New York Times, now\nwriting independently on Substack, which is where I often find\nhim. And since he’s in the United States, I pay no tariff. Mr.\nKrugman, welcome to the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So far, so good. That’s a fair description. But, concluding the five-minute interview, Inskeep goes with this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paul Krugman writes for Substack, formerly with The New York\nTimes. Thanks so much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paul Krugman does not “write for Substack”. No one would say that <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/\">Jason Snell</a> “writes for WordPress”, or that <a href=\"https://kottke.org/\">Jason Kottke</a> or yours truly “writes for Movable Type”. No one says <a href=\"https://www.citationneeded.news/\">Molly White</a>, <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/\">Casey Newton</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.cupofcoffeenews.com/\">Craig Calcaterra</a> “writes for Ghost”, or that <a href=\"https://www.status.news/\">Oliver Darcy</a> “writes for Beehiiv”. Only with Substack does anyone perceive creator branding as being subservient to the platform — something that ought to be seen merely as an interchangeable CMS — like that.</p>\n\n<p>That is not by happenstance. It’s a trap and it is by design. It’s exactly what Substack wants, and exactly what independent writers and content producers should not.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

I think plenty of smart folks might\nfind themselves stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Substack is rickety. It’s as unstable as a SpaceX launch, as\n<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/dems-taunt-stephen-miller-over-191520373.html\">overpromised</a> as a Stephen Miller marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Substack does not have a clear future as a newsletter business,\nI’m not the first to notice that. But it doesn’t have to fail\noutright to be a disaster. It just has to keep trying to become a\nlife-sized map of the internet: maximum content, maximum churn.\nThe center cannot hold — especially not for newsletters, a format\nthat depends on intimacy and long-standing trust.</p>\n\n<p>The Substack bust will not just take out a few hot-take merchants\nand media dilettantes. It’s going to take down a lot of working\njournalists who’ve built modest, sustainable incomes as well as\nthe fragile public sphere we’ve been piecing together in the ashes\nof Twitter and the twilight of traditional journalism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog\">Taylor Lorenz’s scoop</a> today on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification\">Substack’s Nazi notification oopsie</a> reminded me that I’ve been meaning to link to this post from Cox casting a serious stink eye at Substack’s business. As she says up front, “Let’s set Substack’s ‘Nazi problem’ aside for a moment. What if the bigger issue is being stranded on a collapsing platform ... with a bunch of Nazis?”</p>\n\n<p>Substack pitches itself to would-be independent writers as a thriving platform that’s fundamentally about independent blog publishing and email newsletter distribution. That could be a great business. But it would be a relatively small business compared to Substack’s fund raising (over $100 million so far, and currently <a href=\"https://www.newcomer.co/p/scoop-substack-in-talks-to-raise?utm_source=anamariecox&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=substack-did-not-see-that-coming\">looking to raise more</a>) and the implied valuation that fund raising implies (at one point, they were pitching investors that they were worth $1 billion, which is about as realistic as El Gringo Loco Anaranjado’s promises that Mexico will pay for a US border wall).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> is a platform and business that’s actually built for independent writers. So is <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/\">Buttondown</a> (which Cox uses for her site). <a href=\"https://www.beehiiv.com/\">Beehiiv</a> too. There’s a whole cottage industry of creator-oriented blog-cum-newsletter platforms. Substack, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">is a trap</a>. It breaks my heart to see great writers as disparate as <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/\">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/michaelchabon/p/tragic-magic\">Michael Chabon</a> set up their ostensibly independent presences on Substack. Writers check in, but — if Substack gets their way — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKhGHxO-woc\">they won’t check out</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the numbers Cox lays out, Substack’s future looks even worse than I thought. Before they go under, though, their investors will put the screws to them, and Substack will take its heel turn.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://newsletter.anamariecox.com/archive/substack-did-not-see-that-coming/\">newsletter.anamariecox.com/archive/substack-did-not-see…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Now, it has\nofficially filed its answer to the DOJ’s antitrust complaint,\npushing back forcefully against the allegations.</p>\n\n<p>As a refresher, the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit focuses on five major\naspects of the iPhone experience: super apps, cloud streaming\ngames, third-party messaging apps, third-party smartwatches, and\nthird-party digital wallets. In today’s filing, Apple says the DOJ\n“fundamentally misunderstands” those five things.</p>\n\n<p>Apple outlines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DOJ says Apple stifles the success of “super apps,” despite the\nfact that Apple’s rules allow and support such apps, and indeed\na multitude of “super apps” exist on the App Store today.</li>\n<li>DOJ says Apple blocks cloud streaming games, even though Apple\nallows streaming games both over the web and in the App Store\nwhere they can stream games directly to users.</li>\n<li>DOJ says Apple degrades third-party messaging apps, even though\nthey are widely available and enormously popular on iPhone\nalready.</li>\n<li>DOJ says Apple limits the functionality of third-party\nsmartwatches, even though they can effectively pair with iPhone,\nshare data to and from the iPhone via a companion app, and take\nadvantage of certain functionalities Apple has developed, which\nare expanding over time.</li>\n<li>DOJ says Apple withholds access to iPhone hardware necessary for\nthird-party digital wallets to use tap-to-pay technology;\nhowever, Apple developed and provides a mechanism that protects\nuser security.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One part of Apple’s defense that seems mostly proven already is that this industry moves fast and the competitive landscape is always changing. I’d say three of the DOJ’s five main arguments are already stale: Apple has since opened up cloud gaming; third-party messaging apps can now be set as default; and tap-to-pay has been opened up. And I think the other two points, on “super apps” and third-party connected devices like watches, are nonsense. Especially <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything\">the “super apps” thing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Miller, of course, embeds Apple’s full response at the bottom of his post. The argument is worth a read — it’s very cogently and plainly written.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/29/apple-doj-lawsuit-answer-iphone/\">9to5mac.com/2025/07/29/apple-doj-lawsuit-answer-iphone/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Here’s a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/us-iphone-app-store-top-10-2025-07-30.png\">screenshot of the top free iPhone apps today</a>, and a list of the current top 10, using the full names the apps choose to display:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ChatGPT</li>\n<li>Wingstop</li>\n<li>Tea Dating Advice</li>\n<li>Threads</li>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Google Maps</li>\n<li>WhatsApp Messenger</li>\n<li>ParentSquare</li>\n<li>CapCut - Video Editor</li>\n<li>TikTok - Videos, Shop &amp; LIVE</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I might be forgetting or unaware of previous similar situations, but I can’t recall anything like this before, where an app riddled with <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/28/tea-breach-worsens\">outrageous security/privacy vulnerabilities</a> remains virally popular. A Hacker News thread from earlier today <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44732995\">debates why the app is even still available on the App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So is it Apple’s place to yank the app? It feels wrong to me that Apple should completely remove Tea from the App Store, but it’s also true that one of Apple’s fundamental pitches for the App Store — and the App Store’s exclusivity for app distribution in most of the world — is that iOS users can trust any and all apps in the App Store because they’re vetted by Apple. But here’s Tea, sitting at #3, providing a service that many women want, and the entire thing is shockingly untrustworthy. (I fully expect more vulnerabilities to be found and exploited.)</p>\n\n<p>Tea, unsurprisingly, has almost nothing on <a href=\"https://www.teaforwomen.com/\">their website</a> about the security violations their users have suffered, nor any mention in their App Store listing. Their only public acknowledgement of the fiasco is a series of three Instagram posts on July <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMjRl4CPE0z/\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMl3E0TvoML/\">27</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theteapartygirls/p/DMrGSlrJA-e/\">29</a> (the most recent of which acknowledges that they’ve completely disabled the DM feature “temporarily”), and <a href=\"https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident\">this FAQ</a> on their website, that, as far as I can tell, is only discoverable through the “links in bio” on their Instagram profile. Their FAQ only addresses the initial discovery from last week, not <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/\">the more significant one that 404 Media publicized Monday</a> that included the exposure of DMs.</p>\n\n<p>Also fascinating to me is that Tea, though available on both iOS <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tea.tea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">and Android</a>, is seemingly not popular at all on Android. It’s not even listed <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en_US\">in the Play Store’s top free apps</a>. (The Play Store website lists only the top 45, but I scrolled through the entire top 200 on my Pixel.) The current Play Store top 10:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ChatGPT</li>\n<li>TikTok - Videos, Shop &amp; LIVE</li>\n<li>Threads</li>\n<li>WhatsApp Messenger</li>\n<li>Temu: Shop Like a Billionaire</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>TikTok Lite - Faster TikTok</li>\n<li>DramaBox - Stream Drama Shorts</li>\n<li>Cash App</li>\n<li>Snapchat</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More tellingly, Tea doesn’t even crack the Play Store top 200 list for the “Dating” category. (On iOS, it’s in the “Lifestyle” category, but on the Play Store it’s in the “Dating” and “Casual” categories. Perhaps Apple requires apps in the “Dating” category to be full-fledged dating app services, not dating-app-adjacent like Tea.)</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure what explains the disparity in Tea’s popularity by platform. One assumption is that dating is more of a young person’s game, and young people skew slightly more toward iPhone than the US population overall. But from what I can tell, that skew is only about 10 percent. Also, surveys suggest <a href=\"https://www.sci-tech-today.com/stats/iphone-vs-android-user-statistics/\">women are more likely to be iPhone users</a>. But I can’t believe that age or gender demographics alone explain why Tea is #3 in the App Store but doesn’t even crack the top 200 on Android.</p>\n\n<p>I strongly suspect that, although Google hasn’t removed Tea from the Play Store, they’ve delisted it from discovery other than by searching for it by name or following a direct link to its listing. That both jibes with what I’m seeing on the Play Store top lists, and strikes me as a thoughtful balance between the responsibilities of an app store provider. As egregious as Tea’s security exploits have been, removing the app entirely doesn’t seem called for. But delisting it from popularity lists seems like a measured way to discourage new users from trying it unless they’re specifically looking for it. If this is what Google is doing, Apple should follow their lead. (I’ve put in a question to Google’s PR inquiring about this; if/when I get an answer, I’ll update this article.)</p>\n\n\n\n    "

It’s a\nmodel that’s worked well, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed.\nUntil now. As AI begins to reshape nearly every facet of digital\nlife, we’re witnessing a turning point in how we interact with the\nweb. Now, it’s worth asking: is your browser working for you as\nmuch as it should?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Color me skeptical about the idea that my web browser should be “working for me”, rather than serving as a tool for me to work with. The AI hype cycle is pointing to a future where automated agentic web browsers surf automated AI-generated websites. Robots consuming robot-generated content — an infinite loop of AI onanism.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is why today we’re excited to launch Copilot Mode, a new\nexperimental mode in Microsoft Edge, and our next step towards\nbuilding a more powerful way to pilot the web.</p>\n\n<p>With Copilot Mode on, you enable innovative AI features in Edge\nthat enhance your browser. It doesn’t just wait idly for you to\nclick but anticipates what you might want to do next. It doesn’t\njust give you endless tabs to sift through but works with you as a\ncollaborator that makes sense of it all. It keeps you browsing,\ncuts through clutter and removes friction to unlock your flow — all built to the highest Microsoft standards of security, privacy\nand performance trusted by billions of people and businesses\nworldwide — with you as the user always in control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Microsoft is famously known for presenting interfaces that “cut through clutter” and “remove friction”. I’m sure this will be great.</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of the decade-ago <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/29/hbo-netflix\">Netflix strategy espoused by Ted Sarandos</a>: “The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.” I think something similar is behind Microsoft trying to make Copilot front-and-center in Edge, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/29/chrome-ai-shopping\">Google’s concurrent move to junk up Chrome</a> with AI-generated suggestions. Their goal is to make their web browsers chatbots faster than OpenAI can make ChatGPT a web browser.</p>\n\n<p>HBO is still around. It even just <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/14/hbo-max-again\">got its name back</a>.

The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon\njust to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a\npop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for\nthings like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service,\nand returns.</p>\n\n<p>The feature, which is currently available only in English, will\ngenerate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including\nBazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings,\nScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/190657?hl=en#Supported_Review_Partners\">and\nothers</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have never heard of a single one of these “partners”. It’s bad enough that so many web pages themselves are increasingly covered with distracting junk, much of it AI-generated slop. But now browsers themselves will be adding their own layers of distracting cruft atop the websites. The entire premise of Chrome — the reason for its name — is that it was originally designed to simplify the UI of the browser app itself, the “chrome”, at a time when Internet Explorer and even Firefox were increasingly cluttered and confusing. I feel like this is a sign that Chrome is completely losing its way — AI-generated slop from the browser layered atop AI-generated slop in the underlying web pages.</p>\n\n<p>Dare Obasanjo, on Bluesky, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/carnage4life.bsky.social/post/3lv2vvzlbd22o\">takes this news credulously</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google Chrome is now going to provide AI generated summaries of\nonline stores covering topics like customer service, product\nquality, shipping, pricing and return policy.</p>\n\n<p>This is on the heels of Microsoft Edge announcing Copilot mode\nearlier today. Apple’s Safari is being left behind in the AI wars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would argue that Safari is looking ever more like a proverbial glass of ice water in hell. These Chrome AI overviews (Chrome is also, for example, going to start presenting its own <a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/google-business-profiles-menu-ai-summaries-39838.html\">AI-generated menu summaries for restaurants</a>) don’t seem like user-centric features to me. They seem like features designed to turn the dial up on Google’s slice of commissions from web transactions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/google-chrome-adds-ai-powered-store-summaries-to-help-u-s-shoppers/\">techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/google-chrome-adds-ai-powered…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The researcher\nsaid they also found the ability to send a push notification to\nall of Tea’s users.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to overstate how sensitive this data is and how it could\nput Tea’s users at risk if it fell into the wrong hands. When\nsigning up, Tea encourages users to choose an anonymous\nscreenname, but it was trivial for 404 Media to find the real\nworld identities of some users given the nature of their messages,\nwhich Tea has led them to believe were private. Users could be\neasily found via their social media handles, phone numbers, and\nreal names that they shared in these chats. These conversations\nalso frequently make damning accusations against people who are\nalso named in the private messages and in some cases are easy to\nidentify. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Some of the private messages viewed by 404 Media include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One user tells another they just discovered their husband on the\napp being discussed. “I am his wife,” many of the messages say.</li>\n<li>Another appears to show a woman contacting others about a man\nshe is engaged to.</li>\n<li>Multiple messages which appear to show women discussing their\nabortions.</li>\n<li>Chat logs between women discovering they are dating the same\nman, exchanging information such as what car he drives for\nverification.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/26/4chan-tea-breach\">I linked to 404 Media’s coverage</a> of the initial breach at Tea the other day, I wrote, “I’m not accusing Tea in particular of being vibe-coded”. Well, I still don’t know if Tea’s service architecture was vibe-coded, but it’s now clear that whoever made it was shamefully incompetent. They shouldn’t have made <em>any</em> sort of services backend, let alone one like Tea’s that’s intended to carry incredibly sensitive personal information and messages.</p>\n\n<p>This is an outright privacy — and quite possibly, personal security — disaster. With the abortion discussions and the current bifurcation of women’s rights here in the US, it could be a legal disaster, too. 4chan clowns have taken the images and data and <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/whats-going-on-with-the-tea-app-data-leak-the-tea-app-map-and-memes-about-ranking-foids-on-teaspill-explained\">created</a> maps of Tea users’ addresses, and a Mark-Zuckerberg-“Facemash”-style site for ranking users’ appearance.</p>\n\n<p>For women who’ve already signed up and started using Tea, I doubt there’s anything that can be done to remove them from exposure. Even if Tea offers a “delete your account” feature, I wouldn’t trust that it actually deletes <em>anything</em> from their database, let alone everything. And the cat’s already out of the bag for any bad actors who figured out this second exploit before Tea was alerted.</p>\n\n<p>Yet another data point for the argument that any “private messaging” feature that doesn’t use E2EE isn’t actually private at all.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/\">404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

What they’re freaking out about is the new iOS 26 Messages feature (which will be available in Messages on iPadOS and MacOS 26 too — but because these messages are sent as SMS and because the iPhone is so many people’s primary or sole messaging device, it’s the platform they’re focusing on) <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/03/ios-26s-messages-app-has-a-solution-coming-for-unwanted-texts/\">that will automatically sort messages from unknown senders</a> into a new “Unknown Sender” inbox.</p>\n\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/nrsc-letter-ios-26.jpeg\">the NRSC letter</a> (emphasis in original):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s iOS 26 update introduces aggressive message filtering.\nPolitical texts — even from verified and compliant senders-will\nbe treated as spam by default, silently sent to an “Unknown” inbox\nwith no alerts or notifications. That change has profound\nimplications for our ability to fundraise, mobilize voters, and\nrun digital campaigns.</p>\n\n<p><em>It’s important to understand: Apple isn’t just targeting cold\noutreach or spammy actors.</em> Every political message — shortcode,\nlong code, doesn’t matter-gets pushed into the dark. The only\nworkaround-getting a voter to reply — is increasingly rare and\nentirely at the mercy of Apple’s unclear rules. How will a voter\nreply if they never get the message?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s “rules” for this new feature aren’t unclear at all. If a sender is not in your saved contacts and you’ve never sent or responded to a text message from them, they’re considered “unknown”. That’s it. The feature isn’t even really new — you’ve been able to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/block-filter-and-report-messages-iph203ab0be4/ios\">filter messages like this in Messages for years now</a>, but what iOS 26 changes is that it now <s>will be on by default and</s> has a new more prominent — better, IMO — interface for switching between filter views. <strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong that this filtering will be on by default in iOS 26 — I was fooled because I had previously enabled “Filter Unknown Senders” in Settings → Apps → Messages → Unknown &amp; Spam (which you need to scroll down quite a bit to get to). I do think, though, that many more iOS users will be using this feature starting with iOS 26 — it’s both better designed and less hidden.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the NRSC letter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here’s the shift in practice. Today, a voter with an iPhone gets\nour message just like a normal text. In iOS 26, unless that\nperson has already replied, our message is silently sent to the\n“Unknown” inbox. No ping, no badge, just buried in an inbox few\npeople ever check.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve spent years complying with rigorous standards — providing full\ndocumentation, opt-in proof, and message samples via Campaign\nVerify and The Campaign Registry — yet Apple ignores that. <em>Carriers\nrespect it. Apple doesn’t.</em></p>\n\n<p>Estimated prospecting losses: <em>NRSC alone could see a $25M+\nrevenue hit</em>. Since 70% of small-dollar donations come via text,\nand iPhones make up 60% of US mobile devices, <em>the macro effect\ncould be over $500M in lost GOP revenue</em>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, K St and trade groups are asleep at the wheel.\nApple isn’t engaging. But we have only a few weeks left before the\npublic release. <em>If we’re going to push back, it has to be now. We\nhave a very narrow window to fix this.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Unknown Senders” isn’t spam. It’s for ... unknown senders. Which these political texts are. I don’t know anyone who enjoys getting these texts in their primary timeline of messages. What the NRSC is asserting here is that they have a right to put political solicitations in your primary Messages view, and to have them appear as notifications, which is ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there’s no reason to believe that Republican candidates and groups will be more affected by this than Democratic ones. There’s no filtering by message content. It’s just a change to stop sending notifications for texts from unknown senders, and to put those messages in a separate timeline by default. People <em>will</em> check the Unknown Senders timeline occasionally too — all sorts of text messages from bots will go there, including some you want or need.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2025/07/28/republicans-say-apple-update-will-hurt-fundraising/\">politicalwire.com/2025/07/28/republicans-say-apple-update…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

When a user taps on the map to report ICE sightings, the\nlocation data is added to that database, and users within five\nmiles are automatically sent a push notification alerting them.\nPush notifications require developers to have some way of\ndesignating which devices receive them, and while Aaron declined\nto say precisely how the notifications function, he said alerts\nare sent through Apple’s system, not ICEBlock’s, letting him avoid\nkeeping his own database of users or their devices. “We utilized\niCloud in kind of a creative way,” Aaron said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>But you might have spotted the problem: ICEBlock isn’t collecting\ndevice data on iOS, but only because similar data is stored with\nApple instead.</p>\n\n<p>Apple maintains a database of which devices and accounts have\ninstalled a given app, and Carlos Anso from GrapheneOS told me\nthat it likely also tracks device registrations for push\nnotifications. For either ICEBlock’s iOS app or a hypothetical\nAndroid app, law enforcement could demand information directly\nfrom the company, cutting ICEBlock out of the loop. Aaron told me\nthat he has “no idea what Apple would store,” and it “has nothing\nto do with ICEBlock.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/security-vulnerabilities-in-iceblock.html\">Bruce Schneier linked to this story</a> saying “the ICEBlock tool has vulnerabilities”, but I don’t think that’s a fair description. As far as we know, ICEBlock is as private as possible while still enabling push notifications, and a hypothetical Android version couldn’t be as private. But that privacy does depend on trust in Apple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also worth a note:</strong> Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, was an auditor at the Department of Justice but <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/iceblock-app-founder-wife-fired-doj-carolyn-feinstein-2102214\">was fired last month because of her husband’s app</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/cyber-security/707116/iceblock-data-privacy-security-android-version\">theverge.com/cyber-security/707116/iceblock-data-privacy…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Cherney and Stephen Nellis, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those customers for the company’s so-called 14A manufacturing\nprocess are crucial to the success of the technology — so much so\nthat if it fails to secure a big one, it could shut down its\ncutting-edge manufacturing business altogether, according to\nIntel’s quarterly filing on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>The possibility that Intel could drop out of the cutting-edge\nmanufacturing business would be a historic shift for a company\nthat has described itself as a steward of Moore’s Law — an\nobservation by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore about the fast rate\nof development of the chip industry that held true for decades.\nIntel is the only U.S. chipmaker capable of making advanced\ncomputing chips.</p>\n\n<p>Intel has struggled for years due to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-fumbled-revival-an-american-icon-2024-10-29/\">management missteps</a>,\nmissing out on the AI race and losing market share to its longtime\nrival AMD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The beginning of the end for Intel was long before the AI race or the market share they’ve lost to AMD. It was missing out on mobile. From <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/paul-otellinis-intel-can-the-company-that-built-the-future-survive-it/275825/\">a 2013 profile of then-CEO Paul Otellini</a>, by Alexis Madrigal for The Atlantic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, oh, what could have been! Even Otellini betrayed a profound\nsense of disappointment over a decision he made about a\nthen-unreleased product that became the iPhone. Shortly after\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkUpQZxLv4g\">winning Apple’s Mac business</a>, he decided against doing what it\ntook to be the chip in Apple’s paradigm-shifting product.</p>\n\n<p>“We ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you\nwant to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if\nwe’d done it,” Otellini told me in a two-hour conversation during\nhis last month at Intel. “The thing you have to remember is that\nthis was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the\niPhone would do... At the end of the day, there was a chip that\nthey were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price\nfor and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted\ncost. I couldn’t see it. It wasn’t one of these things you can\nmake up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong\nand the volume was 100× what anyone thought.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was it, the beginning of the end. It’s not just that mobile computing, as defined by the iPhone, became the largest market, by far, for chips, but that the needs of mobile devices defined the future of leading edge chipmaking across all industries: performance-per-watt, not merely sheer performance. As mobile grew, so went the economies of scale, which resulted in Apple Silicon eventually beating x86 chips not just in performance-per-watt but also in single-core performance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intels-foundry-future-depends-securing-customer-next-gen-chipmaking-tech-2025-07-25/\">reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intels-foundry-future…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

None of those things are true anymore. But, still. <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\">Cool URLs don’t change</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sure it is true that 99 percent of goo.gl links had no activity in the past month. But I’m just as sure that it would cost next to nothing for Google to keep goo.gl up and running in perpetuity. I mean, 99 percent of <em>all</em> URLs probably had no activity in the last month. 99 percent of all books ever written weren’t read in the last month either, I bet — but that’s no excuse for libraries to throw them in the trash.</p>\n\n<p>It’s fine that Google stopped allowing for the creating of new links a while back, but there’s no reason they should ever stop redirecting existing links. The whole reason anyone might have used goo.gl instead of something like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/\">bit.ly</a> is misplaced trust in Google. I trust Google with almost nothing long-term.

In\nrecent years, ICE has faced criticism for alleged civil rights\nabuses and failures to adhere to constitutional principles and due\nprocess, making it crucial for communities to stay informed about\nits operations.</p>\n\n<p>Modeled after Waze but for ICE sightings, the app ensures user\nprivacy by storing no personal data, making it impossible to trace\nreports back to individual users. Available exclusively for iOS\ndevices, ICEBlock empowers communities to stay informed about ICE\npresence within a 5-mile radius while maintaining their anonymity\nthrough real-time updates and automatic deletion of sightings\nafter four hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ICEBlock app is interesting in and of itself (and from my tire-kicking test drive, appears to be a well-crafted and designed app), as will be Apple’s response if (when?) the Trump administration takes offense to the app’s existence. Back in 2019, kowtowing to tacit demands from China, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/apple-pulls-hkmaps\">Apple removed from the App Store an app called HKmap.live</a> which helped pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong know the location of police and protest activity. The app broke no Hong Kong laws, but <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768841864/after-china-objects-apple-removes-app-used-by-hong-kong-protesters\">scared the thin-skinned skittish lickspittles in the Chinese Communist Party</a>. (Remember too that in 2019, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/07/taiwan-flag-emoji\">Apple removed the Taiwan flag emoji</a> (🇹🇼) from the iOS 13 keyboard for users in Hong Kong and Macau.)</p>\n\n<p>One defense from Apple regarding HKmap.live, however, was that the iOS app was a thin wrapper around the website, which website remained fully functional and could be saved to an iPhone user’s home screen. Removing the app from the App Store thus did not prevent Hong Kongers from accessing it. (<a href=\"https://hkmap.live/\">That website</a> today <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKmap.live\">seems to be defunct</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>ICEBlock is different. It is <em>only</em> available as a native iOS app. According to the developers, this is for technical reasons. From their web page explaining <a href=\"https://www.iceblock.app/android\">why they <em>can’t</em> offer an Android version</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At ICEBlock, user privacy and security are paramount. Our\napplication is designed to provide as much anonymity as possible\nwithout storing any user data or creating accounts. While we\nunderstand the desire for an Android version of ICEBlock,\nachieving this level of anonymity on Android is not feasible due\nto the inherent requirements of push notification services.</p>\n\n<p>To send push notifications on Android, it is necessary to use a\nmechanism that requires storing device IDs. This means that we\nwould need to maintain a privately hosted database to store these\nidentifiers. Storing such data, even if it’s anonymized,\nintroduces significant privacy risks. [...]</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, iOS offers us the flexibility to deliver push\nnotifications while adhering strictly to our design philosophy.\nApple’s ecosystem allows for push notifications to be sent without\nrequiring us to store any user-identifiable information. This\nensures that ICEBlock remains completely anonymous and secure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To deliver push notifications on Android, the developers claim they would need to maintain a database of device IDs, create a user account system to manage those device IDs, and all of that server-stored data would be susceptible to law enforcement subpoenas and pro-ICE red hat hackers. (What “brown shirts” were to the Nazis, we should make “red hats” to MAGA.)</p>\n\n<p>To maintain anonymity and store zero user data, there is and can be no web app version of ICEBlock. There is and can be no Android version. Only iOS supports the security and privacy features for ICEBlock to offer what it does, the way it does. Here’s to hoping that Apple will proudly defend it if push comes to shove.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
